Hello Everyone, welcome to CITS2002 Systems Programming in 2017.

FIRSTLY, if you read nothing else, please read this section.

Our unit this year has a record enrolment - about 310 confirmed
enrolments, up from 240 last year.  NOT ALL ENROLLED STUDENTS WILL
FIT IN OUR LECTURES and workshop venues (holding 250-260 students),
and we don't have sufficient lab times or spaces for all students
to be guaranteed a seat in our weekly lab sessions.

IF YOU BELIEVE that you can learn introductory material just as
effectively from lecture recordings, then THIS FIRST WEEK'S LECTURES
may be a good time to put that into practice.  Hopefully we can
manage this way until lecture attendance drops off, as it always
does, in week-2.

*** If you have a specific question that you'd like me to answer in
    the 1st lecture, please just email it to me beforehand.

(I'm not panicking about this and I don't think that you'll need to
 either.  (Too many) years of experience have shown that a reasonable
 proportion of students choose to not attend all lectures and a
 weekly lab, choosing to just watch the LCS lecture recordings and
 use their own labtops for all laboratory and project work.  In
 previous years I have worried about this, adding extra repeat
 lectures, only to find that the only available times and venues
 were at 5PM or 6PM;  barely 20 students attended the repeat sessions,
 and students drifted away from the original lectures anyway.)

-------

We'll spend some time in the first lecture on Tuesday discussing
how the unit will run this year, but first I'll head off some common
questions that students are asking by email:

Firstly, we're not using LMS/Blackboard for this unit.
All teaching materials will be available from:

    http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/

LECTURES:
    We have 2 45 minute lectures each week. All lectures will be recorded
    and available via LCS. The schedule of lecture topics, in fact all
    sessions in the unit, is available from the left-margin of the
    unit's homepage. HTML and PDFs of all lectures will be available
    to read or download ahead of time.
    Attendance at lectures is not compulsory.

WORKSHOPS:
    Most weeks we'll hold a workshop on Fridays, to review the week's
    material by focusing on the design and implementation of a short
    program addressing a single problem. You'll receive the problem
    ahead of time, hopefully sketch out a solution, and we'll discuss
    it in the Friday workshops. The workshops are in a lecture venue,
    not a computing lab, so you may wish to bring your laptops along.
    Attendance at workshops is not compulsory.

LABORATORIES:
    The allocated laboratory times are times at which there'll be someone
    there to assist you.  Most weeks, when the two projects are "not
    running", will have a laboratory sheet of 3-4 "standard" questions,
    and often a couple of more difficult questions, for you to attempt
    that week.  Sample solutions to the standard questions will be
    provided.  If you can successfully complete the sample questions,
    each week, then you're keeping up in the unit.
    Attendance at laboratories is not compulsory.  Come along if you
    need to use a computer, or if you need some help with a question.
    There's no requirement to stay the full 2 hours.  Labs are open
    24/7 although, of course, students allocated to other units' lab
    sessions have priority.

Hello Everyone,

I've asked the LCS/Echo360 Gods to permit our unit's recordings to be available from 
outside Blackboard, and accessible from our webpage's left-hand margin without requiring 
you to login to Blackboard (as it's been in previous years).

Until then, you can access last Tuesday's lecture via Blackboard (ho hum!).

Chris.

According to CAS (the class allocation system), there is a lab from 8-10am. However, 
from the lectures, it seems that they will be unsupervised. Is this true? If so, is 
it ok to attend another lab time?

The lab times listed on the unit homepage ( 
http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/index.php ) are the ones that shall be 
supervised. At least, as far as I am aware.
It is perfectly acceptable, and encouraged, to attend whichever lab time(s) you can make it 
to. If you find the lab exercises for a particular week a breeze, that's great. If you need 
a hand with something, turn up to any of the labs and someone will be there to help you 
out. If you're feeling the pressure (Say, a project is due...), feel free to stay for all 
the hours you need.

If it's a lab time, someone will be there to help.

tl;dr:
CAS lies, check the unit website.
Turn up anytime, for however long you feel like, to whichever lab you can.

Someone emailed this question to me, but the question and reply deserve a broader audience:

____
Hi Chris

I have a question about C naming conventions.

I know from past java courses that functions and variables have a specific convention to 
how they should be represented.

I was wondering what the convention is for this unit?
_____

In CITS2002 I'll not mandate a specific naming/coding convention, and you'll not be 
assessed against one.  Instead we'll identify a few different approaches or techniques when 
first seeing something new.  The primary message is to be *consistent* - whatever 
convention that *you* adopt, personally, needs to be applied consistently through a C 
program, ideally through all of your C programs.  The two projects will be assessed for 
their consistent presentation, but not for a specific one.

I'm not a fan a mandating a single coding convention as I believe it can be resented by 
students that may not like the convention I choose.  Moreover, when you start to read code 
from others, often found on the web, there can be a small 'mental block' in understanding 
that foreign code if it's not a style you're incorrectly expecting, and that can creep over 
into what you understand about a language.

Hmm, looks like that safety is refusing to be turned off. I think some (or all) of the lab 
environments have -Wall enabled as a default option (Can not confirm, but I've seen this happen 
before).

To get the effect this exercise is looking for, there may be a compiler option to disable 
warnings.
IMPORTANT: Do Not force-disable all warnings unless you 200% know what you are doing.

With that said, check the manual ('man cc' in the terminal should bring it up). There's a lot of 
interesting stuff in there.

If all else fails, rock up to a lab this upcoming week, the first one is on Tuesday at 15:00 in 
2.03.

The takeaway from this exercise, however, is to always use -Wall and -Werror when compiling. 
Otherwise the compiler will produce a program that will do exactly what you told it to do. Which 
probably wasn't what you wanted it to do. And without -Wall or equivalent, it won't even tell you about 
it.

From: poster083@student.uwa.edu.au
X-smilie: none

(First time coding c in this unit, remoting into the CSSE computers with PuTTY)

I managed to wrangle a solution for ex 9 of the labsheet, but whenever I print from 
a file, the last thing it writes is always a 'medium shade' character (according to 
google)

u, from original h, located at 1 (in file) (ascii:104)
r, from original e, located at 2 (in file) (ascii:101)
y, from original l, located at 3 (in file) (ascii:108)
y, from original l, located at 4 (in file) (ascii:108)
b, from original o, located at 5 (in file) (ascii:111)

j, from original w, located at 7 (in file) (ascii:119)
b, from original o, located at 8 (in file) (ascii:111)
e, from original r, located at 9 (in file) (ascii:114)
y, from original l, located at 10 (in file) (ascii:108)
q, from original d, located at 11 (in file) (ascii:100)

▒, from original ▒, located at 12 (in file) (ascii:-1)


The program makes a blank line whenever it reads a character that's not between 
ASCII 48 and 126 (i.e. it shouldn't print that whole 'from original' spiel unless ▒ 
is between those bounds) 

Listed after 'ascii:' is the value the file stream gives, needless to say -1 is 
confusing.

Obviously not a program breaking solution, just really curious what it could be. 
Thoughts?

Hi there,

Will answers to each lab sheet be posted on CITS2002? Obviously if your code works, it

Great to hear that you're making the anticipated progress (tell others that it *is* possible!)

This certainly sounds like where your error is - at the end of your line containing'hello 
world' will be a newline character;  as it's not an alphabetic character, it shouldn't be 
rotated.

Also, your mentioning that the values needing to be between 48 and 126 suggests that you're a 
bit confused about that bit. We're only rotating alphabetic characters, and the *lowercase* 
alphabetic characters are between decimal 97 (a) and 122 (z) - run   'man ascii'.

Ideally, you should be comparing values against their numeric/integer representations, but 
between the relevant characters - between 'a' and 'z'.

As Trent has stated, sample solutions will be provided at the end of each labsheet's week.  They 
will be *sample* solutions, that answer the question, but shouldn't be taken as the only possible 
solution.

In addition, take care with thoughts such as "Obviously if your code works, it works"; it's not 
always the case.  Code that works for one type or set of input values may not work for all inputs 
(valid and invalid) if it hasn't been widely tested.  And testing only identifies the presence of 
bugs, not the absence of bugs.

Your concerns are not unusual and expressed by students, each year,
at the beginning of CITS2002.  Even if you've never used a Macintosh
before, you'll not be disadvantaged relative to other students in
the unit - in fact most students haven't used a Macintosh before,
perhaps other than for some recreational computing.  You're not
being placed at a disadvantage, but are just feeling that you're
outside of your comfort zone.  But you're at university to learn
things, not to keep within familiar bounds.

It's a strong belief within our School and our degree accreditation
bodies that computing students should see a diversity of operating
system platforms and programming languages across their degree, not
just the ones that they already know, so we support and use the 3
primary desktop and server operating systems in our School by
requiring you to use them in different units.  You do not need to
purchase Apple hardware to undertake the unit, can undertake all
laboratory and project work on Linux instead (or, as well), and can
access the Macs in Lab 2.03 from across the network, without needing
to sit in front of one.

While it's certainly true that the Windows operating system dominates
the desktop environment, and thus most people are more familiar
with it, there is a significant proportion of the computing world
that isn't dominated by Windows - and that's the back-end server
market, the cloud computing market, and the embedded systems market.
The great majority of computing in these 3 areas is performed by
open-source Unix-based systems, such as Linux and BSD-based systems.
To the extent that we're learning about open-source software,
interfaces, and libraries in CITS2002, the Mac operating system
provides strong (often the strongest) support for the standards
that we're learning about.

You're right, that's what it turned out to be. The part of my script that was meant to exclude non-

Also fixed, I had it include 65-90 as well as 97-122 because of the uppercase functionality part.

Hi Sam,

Glad that you've found the problem.
Also, I'm a pedant when it comes to correct terminology, so let's use "code" or "program", in preference to  
"script", as we're not interpreting the C code.
 
> Also fixed, I had it include 65-90 as well as 97-122 because of the uppercase functionality part.

Good, but it's much preferred if you make your comparisons between 'A' and 'Z', and 'a' and 'z', rather than 
their numeric equivalents - the code becomes far more readable.

Even, even, better is to use some standard C functions,  declared in the <ctype.h> header file, which are named 
isupper() and islower().

... is now available from:

   http://undergraduate.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/workshops/mycal.c

The provided solution is very close to the one we developed in Workshop-2, with comments added so
we'll still understand it in a few weeks' time.

As presented, this solution is "at the level" of understanding that I'm hoping/anticipating that
all students will now have at the end of Week-2.  The solution doesn't use anything complex, just
concepts that have been introduced in lectures and Labsheet-1.

--------
OK, how can we improve it?
The solution's biggest flaw is that we must edit and recompile it to make it work for another month
and year.  Instead, we prefer the program to accept the required month and year via the command-line.
To start, we'll also need to provide the weekday of the 1st of the month, too.

Modify the program (work out where!) to call C's atoi() function, which will convert a character
string to an integer:

  if(argc == 4)
  {
     month    = atoi( argv[1] );
     year     = atoi( argv[2] );
     day1     = atoi( argv[3] );
  }

and now run the program as:    ./mycal 8 2017 5

--------
But knowing and having to provide the weekday of the 1st of the month is annoying, so we ask (more
complicated, but still standard) functions to provide this information.
A commented version of this code is available from:

  http://undergraduate.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/workshops/first_day_of_month.c

** WARNING - beyond the anticipated knowledge of most students at this stage:

Provide additional code:

#include <string.h>
#include <time.h>

int first_day_of_month(int m, int y)
{
    struct tm   timeptr;

    memset(&timeptr, 0, sizeof(timeptr));
    timeptr.tm_mday     = 1;
    timeptr.tm_mon      = m-1;
    timeptr.tm_year     = y-1900;
    mktime(&timeptr);

    return timeptr.tm_wday;
}

and call it with     day1 = first_day_of_month(month, year);

and now we only need to run our program with:   ./mycal 8 2017

This is my solution to questions 6 and 7. Question 6 is handled through the extra loop in the
else statement in main(). Question 7 is embodied in changes to the way ROT is initialised and
passed through the functions (passed to rotate() in main()). If anyone has feedback on a better
way to integrate ROT and pass it to the rotate function I would be interested.

// rot.c

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <ctype.h>

// Compile this program with:
//      cc -std=c99 -Wall -Werror -pedantic -o rot rot.c

//  The rotate function returns the character ROT positions further along the
//  alphabetic character sequence from c, or c if c is not lower-case

char rotate(int ROT, char c)
{
        // Check if c is lower-case or not
        if (islower(c))
        {
                // The ciphered character is ROT positions beyond c,

Nice work Jessica. It looks like I've implemented mine essentially the same way you have. I managed
to rig it up so that it can read files as well although I'm sure there is a simpler way to do it
than I have... I attempted to redirect stdin to read the file but then had trouble with the
argument count and vector arguments for the main function. 

If anybody is offended by my code (haha!) I'd appreciate some feedback so that I may write better
code. Cheers!

Anyway here it is:

From: poster101@student.uwa.edu.au

Hello everyone, here's my approach to rotating a text file.
It works as expected, rotating A-Z and a-z, without touching punctuation and newlines. 
However it always prints a question mark ("?") at the end of a file (this doesn't happen 
when I input text in the CLI).

I'd appreciate it if someone could take a look at my code:

...

  FILE *file_read;

  // expect file name as first argument
  // open file as read-only
  file_read = fopen(argv[1], "r");

  // if file exists rotate its content one character at a time
  // else close file and rotate arguments
  if (file_read != NULL) {
    int ROT = 13;
    int ch = 0;

    // loop until the end of the file
    // EOF = -1
    while (ch != EOF) {
      // read character in ch, returns an int
      ch = fgetc(file_read);
      printf("%c", rotate(ch, ROT));
    }

    // close file
    fclose(file_read);;
  }

...

Thanks to anyone that'll take some time to help me out!
Tommaso

Hi Chris,

I know you mentioned the linux subsystem on windows 10, but I thought I would post how to
set it up for those who want to use a windows machine but the unix command line.

Personally I find it quite useful to quickly type "bash" in the start menu then its up and
running, but for reference it does have its limitations (for instance can't access all
hardware, including USB's), so I do also have Ubuntu set up in virtualbox for the full unix
os. And of course ssh to the macs at uni.

Hope this is useful for someone. You will need admin rights and a decent internet
connection. You will also need relatively recent windows updates (anniversary update) and
64-bit architecture.

1. Open the settings app -> update and security -> developer mode. 
2. Search for "turn windows features on or off" or open it in control panel (programs and
features). Find "Windows Subsystem for Linux (beta)" and check it. Reboot if prompted.
3. Type "bash" into start menu or find it in the apps list. Follow the prompts, create root
(sudo) password.
4. Optional - install vim. Go to the exe file at
https://ftp.nluug.nl/pub/vim/pc/gvim80-586.exe and install. Open bash then type vim to run.

Your home folder (~) is at C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\lxss\home\user and you won't see
\lxss when browsing in file explorer, you'll need to type it in the address bar.

Hope this was useful for someone!

Hi Tommaso,

The problem is caused by the bit of your code I've left, above.

*IF* there was a special character at the end of each file, represented by the constant -1 and 
referred to by EOF, then you'd still be printing out that character, once, before leaving the 
while loop.  It's probably not printing an actual question mark character, but using the 
question mark to indicate that it's outputting a character that it can't display.

Another way to write it could be:

      while(true) {
        // read character in ch, returns an int
        ch = fgetc(file_read);
        if(cc == EOF) {
          break;
        }
        printf("%c", rotate(ch, ROT));
      }

HOWEVER, there is no such special character at the end of the file, so a better way to do this 
is to test for the *condition* of being at the end-of-file using a standard predicate declared 
in the <stdio.h> header file:

      while( ! feof(file_read) ) {
        ......
      }

Hope this helps,

Indeed;  using feof() to detect end-of-file won't change what fgetc() returns.

I still suspect that it's not returning a question-mark.  To test, try:

    ch = fgetc( file );
    printf("got %i\n", ch);

and I bet it won't give 63 (the ASCII value for question mark).

Not quite coincidently, in tomorrow's lecture I'll discuss why the above line works, but is not the ideal

Thanks for posting this, Philip.

However, it doesn't actually answer the question asked in Q10.
We're looking for a self-describing sentence - have a look at the Wikipedia article for 
'autogram', which gives the example:

This sentence employs two a’s, two c’s, two d’s, twenty-eight e’s, five f’s, three g’s, 
eight h’s, eleven i’s, three l’s, two m’s, thirteen n’s, nine o’s, two p’s, five r’s, 
twenty-five s’s, twenty-three t’s, six v’s, ten w’s, two x’s, five y’s, and one z.

(I haven't checked it) but the above sentence will have 5 f's in it.

A much harder problem!

Ah I see now.

All my program does is count the occurrences of each letter but what you need is a self describing sentence.

In this case one that not counts the occurrences of each letter including the letters in the (worded)
numbers that tells you the number of occurrences.

Heres my attempt at q10 of lab 2. It works for the test cases i gave it but i feel

What sort of problems are you having?
You can (should be able to) download the lecture's PDF file, open it in your operating 
system's favourite PDF viewer, and then print it via a standard menu item.

Hello   

char creditCard[20];
  printf("Print Credit Card: ");
  scanf("%s", creditCard);
  int sum = 0;
  if(strlen(creditCard) >= 13 && strlen(creditCard) <= 16)
  {
    for(int i = strlen(creditCard)-1; i > 0; i = i - 2)
    {
      sum = sum + creditCard[i];
        printf("Sum = %d\n", sum);
    }
  }

okay so i am trying to add the odd integers:
Input - Print Credit Card: 1234567890987654
Output - 
         Sum = 52
         Sum = 106
         Sum = 162
         Sum = 210
         Sum = 266
         Sum = 320
         Sum = 372
         Sum = 422

Can someone please explain how i am getting the output? What i was trying to do is 
to go through the array backwards, starting from the last int in the array and 
take that number and add it to sum and so on. I'm not sure why i get the first 
output as 52.

Thankyou :)

The first value you get is 52 because you're adding together the internal, ASCII, representations of 
each character, and not the digits that you hope you're seeing.
The internal representation of the character '4' is 52  (run  man ascii,  see the decimal set)

If you wish the value 52 to be more useful to you, you need to subtract from it the internal 
representation of the digit '0':   (creditCard[i] - '0')
which will work without us having to know the actual internal values of each character - just 
assuming that '4' is a distance of four from '0', as we'd hope.

Also, the value  strlen(creditCard)
never changes throughout your program, so don't calculate it 3 times :-)

Hi Chris,

Just wondering how I would get started on this task? I can check each letter in the input 
string using isupper(), islower() and isdigit(), but how would I check if there are at 
least 2 of these? Is there a specific function to "count" them or should I create new 
variables say "numUpper","numLower","numDigit" and return true if they are all 2 or more. 
Sorry for the dumb question.

Cheers

Should we print the output e.g. printf("this string has %d vowels",numVowels) in the main 
function or in the sub functions, then just call the function name in the main function?

Right now my main function looks like:

int main(int argc,char *argv[])
{
strLength(argv[1]);
numVowels(argv[1]);
isSafe(argv[1]);
return 0;
}

There's no single function to do it all, so you'll need to iterate over the string, counting each of 
the 3 types of characters.  Each of the 3 character types are disjoint, so that should drive/help 
your testing.

There's no 'one rule fits all situations' here, and it's a small example, so it doesn't really matter 
here.

However, you probably have 3 nearly identical functions, each iterating over the same string, so I'd 
collapse that to a single function which counts once, and prints once.

Hi

Perhaps asking if the character you want is between 'a' and 'z', 'A' and 'Z' or '0' and 
'9'

basically it means that if you get a product greater than or equal to 10, you add the two 
digits together 
for example: 7*2 = 14 = 1 + 4 = 5 and so you add the 5 to the total even sum.

If you look at your code in the creditCard function, you'll see you are returning the value 0, regardless of what 
happens inside the algorithm. I would double check what it is you wanted to return from that function, and see what 
you can do to change that. 

>is there an error in my code? i am trying to run it with my visa credit card and the output return's as Credit card

Check your line; 

        sum = sumE + sumO;

And where it is in the code. You might find it is not where you want it to be...

This is the line in which the error is really occurring (Apart from the non-
initialization of the variable i pointed out by Chris). What you are doing is 
traversing both the p and s char arrays until a null byte is reached. Given your s 
array is equal to "s", the while loop exits right after the completion of the 1st 
iteration. You would like to traverse only the p array copying the contents across to 
the s array.

What does it mean to "perform the minimum amount of work in the main function"? What 
should and shouldn't be in the main function, that is, do we call simply call other 
functions in main instead of writing all the code there?

Would this be an acceptable example of what main should look like (from the week 3 
lab)? I haven't coded anything in main(), only called the other functions in print 
statements to output what was requested. Thanks.

I interpret it to mean something along the lines of minimizing the amount of code logic 
contained within the main function. In other words, calling other user defined functions 
from the main function is a more effective approach and introduces cleaner code, 
maintainability, and re-usability.

For example:

void functionA();
void functionB();
void printString(char* str);

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    functionA();
    functionB();
    printString(*argv);
    printString(*(argv+1));
    etc.

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

void functionA()
{
    //5 lines of code here.
}

void functionB()
{
    //10 lines of code here.
}

void printString(char* str)
{
    //3 lines of code here.
}

This is more readable and far easier to maintain than this:

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    Code for functionA (5 lines)
    Code for functionB (10 lines)
    Code for printing 1st element of argv (3 lines)
    Code for printing 2nd element of argv (3 lines)
    etc.

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

As you can see, the main function is now cluttered with many different functions serving 
different purposes as well as containing the logic for each of those different functions. 
It becomes a lot harder to modify the code and to ensure that the program doesn't break 
from modifications. In the scope of these labs, this isn't such an issue but when you 
start to develop larger programs, the format of the first example is far superior and 
will save you from many potential issues that can arise.

From: poster019@student.uwa.edu.au

Hi all,
I found exercise 2 in this week's lab surprisingly difficult. My program ended up 
quite large (larger than most previous labs).

I have created what I think is a correct solution to the problem. However, I am 
worried that there is a much simpler and shorter way to do this problem.

I have provided my source code for this, called 'cards.c'. I tried to document 
everything in it, but as you will see it is complicated.

I also had many issues 'returning strings' or arrays in general. I ended up simply 
returning pointers to locally created arrays (/strings) which were static. I am 
wondering if this inelegant solution is the right one.

Regards,
Harsimran Singh

Hello Harsimran,

Yes, your solution looks much more complicated than it needs to be.
Other than main(), you should only need 2 or 3 other functions;  in my sample solution their names and 
prototypes are:

    void shuffle_cards(int cards[])
and
    void print_cards(int cards[])

There's no need to manage or return any arrays of strings.
The deck of cards can be represented by an integer array, contents 0..51, and you can make better 
use of your constants NUM_SUITS and NUM_RANKS to determine what each number, 0..51, represents.
For example the number 19 is the 6th card from the 2nd suit.

Does that help?

Your next_number() function is not correctly adding a terminating null-byte to digits.
Your code, above, tells you this when processing the string of "123", and the reported string 
length of digits is 4.

Hi Chris,
Yes that helped a lot. I was representing the deck in a far too complicated fashion, rather than just a 
unique int for each card. This complicated the output of the cards as well.

Thanks for your help.

Other than the bug Chris mentioned above (it actually manages to run past that point some of 
the time, depending on initial values of digits array), you also have an issue with your 
insert function which occurs when you are inserting a value larger than all previous values. 
The reason the code isn't outputting the line "num is %d" is because there is no new line 
character, causing the stdout buffer to not be flushed (and hence no output).

Hello,

In preparing for the mid-semester test, I am quite confident with the actual C 
programming content of the unit, but not so much when it comes to the operating 
systems and theory side of things. This is mainly because a wide range of topics are 
discussed in lectures (some in a great amount of detail) and I don't know which 
concepts/details to focus on. 

While reviewing the 2016 paper has been useful, it is quite a small sample of the 
kinds of questions that could be asked this year, so is there any other material that 
would be recommended to study from? 

Thanks.

The first error message tells you where the error is located and occurs when you try 
to pass the temp variable into the strcpy function (Argument 1 as it states).

The rest of the error messages tell you what is actually causing the error and where 
other instances of the error(s) are located.

It states that you are passing an incompatible variable type to the function. The 
function is looking for a pointer that is of type char (You will learn more about this 
in week 8 looking at the timetable), and you are providing it a 5 element array 
pointer of type char. If you change the input argument to temp[0] (or using pointers, 
*temp), it should fix the problem with the incompatible input types and also ensures 
that you are pointing to the correct memory location for the data you are modifying.

From: chris.mcdonald@uwa.edu.au
X-smilie: none

Someone emailed me this question:

I am running through the solutions for Lab sheet 3 and was wondering in the below code, 
what the action of the  ( - ‘0’ ) has on digit

Thanks!

  for(int i = strlen(creditcard)-1 ; i >= 0  ; i = i-1) {
        char digit = creditcard[i] - '0';

        if(odd) {
            s1 += digit;
        ....
   }

______
 From each character in the character array creditcard, we subtract the value of the 
character zero, written as '0', to determine the integer represented by each character.

For example,  if an array element was the character '4', then the expression
('4' - '0') has the integer value of 4.
Thus we're "converting" from the single character to the integer it's representing.

We've done something similar when manipulating lowercase characters:  (ch - 'a') way back 
in Labsheet-1.

You'll again need this same code in Q1 of Labsheet-4.

A function of type void is just a function that does not return a value. This does 
not mean that it can not have return statements.

A simple example:

void function(int number)
{
    if (number < 0)
    {
        return;
    }
    if (number > 10)
    {
        return;
    }
    etc.
    
    printf("Number is %d \n", number);
}

For an example this code is fine, but it is best to avoid splitting similar 
conditionals and combining them into a single if statement:

    if (number < 0 || number > 10)

The return statements basically act like an exit from the function similar in 
functionality to that of a break statement in a loop. If the input number is less 
than 0 or more than 10, the function exits early without continuing on to print the 
number. In other words, once a function sees a return statement, it has found its 
solution or requirement and just stops itself from executing any code beyond that 
return statement.

You can have as many return statements as you like.

Represents a deck of cards as the numbers 1 - 52. 1 - 13 are the hearts, 14 - 26 the

Thought i'd share this seeing as it's helped me get through the labs a bit quicker 
and easier.

To streamline the task solving process I codemonkey'd a program that can generate a 
typical C file we use when writing solutions. Just write a file titled 'generate.c' 
or similar that looks something like this:


   #!/bin/bash
   #run the program with bash

   cat << EOF

   //code that you want in your typical file, e.g:

   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <stdlib.h>

   int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {

       return 0;
   }
   EOF


 From there, you can create an alias of the directory of that file to something easy 
to type. Mine was located in ~/Documents/CITS2002, so I wrote:
alias gen="~/Documents/CITS2002/generate.c >";

the > funnels the output of the generate program into a filename that you type 
after it

To make sure that alias (and any others you want) stay permanent, modify your 
~/.profile file with the alias command. (I think this was in the lectures/labs?)

Please let me know if any of this is wrong/not up to standard

Hi,

I've been working on the first project and just thought I'd ask for a minor clarification.

In the OUI files, the same vendor name can be associated with multiple MAC prefixes. I 
assume we should group together all packets with the same vendor name even if they have 
different prefixes, but then what should we output as the prefix for that vendor? I assume 
just the first one we encounter in the input file?

Kind regards,
Alex

No, don't 'collapse' multiple OUIs into a single vendor.
It's quite feasible that, say, Samsung records the top-10 transmitters, and so the 10 different OUIs 
should be listed.

Okay, thanks for clarifying that. That actually simplifies my code a lot.

What about unknown vendors? Should these not be collapsed together into one entry either? If not, why does the 
sample output show "??:??:??" for UNKOWN-VENDOR?

I dont know whether i should do this or just

Keep in mind that your program is not doing the sorting (of its array variables), but the 
sorting is done by an external program.  Perhaps re-read the question sheet.

Some questions emailed directly to me - answers for all!
________

Q: Do 3 byte MAC addresses become short forms for a list of 6 byte MAC addresses?

No; the 3-byte OUI prefix simply indicates with vendor made the WiFi card used in the 
transmission.  Vendor pay a licence/royalty fee to the IEEE to adopt their WiFi 
standard(s), and a vendor may license ('own') several different OUIs;  e.g. Samsung owns 
493 OUIs in the large OUI file.

 
Q: Is this a standard for companies to say that all their computers MAC addresses contain 
the first 3 byte MAC addresses?

Yes, pay your money and you, too, can have your own OUIs:

  https://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/oui/index.html


Q: Is there an include statement for sort?

No, include files provide prototypes for functions - our project is not using a C99 
function to sort its output, but using an external program.  Suggest that you listen to 
today's workshop recording.

(P.S. there is a standard C99 function named qsort(), but we're not using it)

The project specifications state: "maximum number of distinct MAC addresses - 500."

However, the sample-packets-large file has slightly over 13,000 distinct transmitter

Am I misunderstanding the project specifications? Are we merely supposed to use a 
subset of the sample-packets-large file for testing? Or is this an error in the 
sample-packets-large file or the project specifications?

Don't forget that you can use errno and perror() to report the actual problem.

Unless you're running your processes as root (not advisable), you won't have permission to create 
files in the root directory. Why do you want to create a text file there?

Can't answer the question, but just quick correction:
The OUIs are not space separated, they are dash separated.

On another note, you should probably never assume that users are going to be perfectly
compliant when you write software, or that data will never deviate from one format. It
would be better (and honestly not much extra work, and no extra complexity) to write
your program such that it deals correctly with any valid format (i.e.
lowercase/uppercase and dash-separated/colon-separated) for both packets and OUIs. It's
really just a few extra checks.

MAC addresses and OUIs should be accepted in any correctly formatted combination of upper- and

Hi Chris,

Is it correct to assume that one should be able to come up with an efficient (15/15) 
solution to Project 1 using only knowledge obtained from the lectures and labs from Week 1

For example, you have not covered pointers and addresses yet but my solution uses them. 
Does that mean my solution is inefficient because it can be accomplished with a simpler

If there are multiple vendors that aren't listed in the OUI file, should their data

being printed.

My guess is them all being summed together, and I would check but I can't find the

You can attain full marks for the project from the concepts presented to the end of Week-6.
No need to read-ahead for any as-yet-unseen concepts, but you'll need to also read online 
documentation to use the introductory concepts correctly.

The sample solution is 360 lines long, including 65 blank lines and 35 comment-only lines.
It uses no pointers, other that the parameter in a single call to wait().
It's deliberately written in a way that I believe all students should be able to write.

The project is not seeking any degree of efficiency in terms of speed or size, but should not be 
wasteful in its coding or excessively large data structures.

Yes, collapse all unknown OUIs into the single 'UNKNOWN-VENDOR' and add all their traffic

No limit on the number of packets,
but the traffic for each/any device will not exceed what can fit in a 32-bit integer.

Is it not limited by the MTU (maximum transmission unit)? Where it is 1500byes for ethernet and 
up to 2304 bytes for WLAN (802.11).

Those figures are per-packet limits,
which is not what Mark was asking about.

Hi all,

When I went to test my implementation of wifistats I had to do a lot of trial and error to 
figure out what was going on, and I eventually realised the problem came down to how I was 
treating lines with broadcast MAC addresses.

When I read the spec, I assumed that you only had to ignore a line if the MAC address we 
were listing by was a broadcast address (i.e. the 2nd column if 't' was set in the command 
line args, the 3rd if it was 'r').

In actuality, you have to ignore a line if either of the MAC addresses are broadcast, 
regardless of what the program is listing by.

Just thought I'd put this clarification out there in case anyone else is scratching their 
heads over why their program is giving different results to the reference implementation.

Hi Alexander,

It doesn't make sense to me for the source address to be a broadcast address. I think if a line
has a broadcast address in it, it's going to be the recipient address. If I'm sending a packet,
it makes sense for me to say I want to send it to everyone (so I'm the transmitter, and the
recipient is the broadcast address). I can't see how it would make sense to say I've received a
packet from everyone (i.e. the transmitter address being a broadcast).

So I think, in reality, you are supposed to ignore packets sent to the broadcast address, which
you weren't doing originally in the case of 't' being set in your command line arguments. Hence
why your output was incorrect.

Hi Alex,

Just to clarify something - the MAC addresses we're seeing in our project are of two types: either 
unique MAC addresses belonging to a single device, or broadcast addresses (ff:ff:....) which 
collectively describe all addresses.  While it makes sense for the broadcast address to be listed as 
the destination/receiver of WiFi traffic,  you'll never see it as a transmitter's address.

Ooops... I feel a bit silly now. It didn't occur to me before, but of course transmitters can't be the broadcast 
address. I just wasn't thinking.

And yes Ammar, you're correct. When listing by transmitter, I wasn't looking at whether or not the receiver was 
the broadcast address, hence the discrepancy.

I think I've got a mostly solid grasp of the concepts involved to complete this 
assignment, but there are a few implementation quirks that I'm not entirely sure 
about.

Unix sort parses a text file, and then sorts and cats it to stdout, but it can also 
parse stdin directly. The simplest way I can think of is to write a temporary file in 
the working directory, and then run sort on that temp file. But, that seems messy 
because of the unnecessary disk IOPs? Is this the intended method, or are we 
expected/is it possible to use a pipeline? (I'm familiar with the concept, but don't 
really know how to implement it in C)

Also, I'm a little bit confused about the necessecity of forking our process before 
exec'ing sort. It seems like all the formatting and filtering should be done before 
sort is needed, and sort doesn't need to return anything, so is there a specific 
reason for the fork? Without anything more to do I would think that after the fork 
the parent would simply terminate.

If anyone could help clear this up I'd appreciate it a lot.

Thanks,
Jesse Wyatt

Hi, 
I was just wondering if there were any coding styles that are preferred or enforced
by the university. 

I tend to put my braces on the same line as the control statement starts:
int main() {
    ...
}
whereas I know some places prefer
int main()
{
    ...
}

I'm also curious about pointer positioning (char* var vs char *var) as well as
spaces vs tabs for indentation (I prefer tabs with tabs = 4 spaces, but I know
Google uses 2 spaces).

Thanks

The reason why we are forking our process is because we still have operations to do after
invoking /usr/bin/sort (namely printing our newly sorted data to stdout). The execve()
family of commands do not necessarily return on success, instead the process that calls
execve() has its own process terminated (see https://linux.die.net/man/2/execve and note
that the text, data, bss and stack of the parent are overwritten). The required command to
be used is execv(), which is a front-end for execve() (which means that it just
reinterprets its input parameters to pass to execve()) also does not return on success,
and thus should be forked.

Of course, not all execv() and execve() implementations terminate the current process (I
know on my computer it doesn't), so you might want to call exit() after execv().

With regards to passing data to /usr/bin/sort, I'm currently using a temporary file,
however the semantics are very similar with pipes (see
http://tldp.org/LDP/lpg/node11.html). As I only have easy access to a linux machine at
home, I'm not sure whether the method would be identical on a mac (though I suspect that
it would be as they are both Unix based and POSIX compliant).

I am not sure what happened here, as the microphone was on and transmitting during the lecture.

I will send some emails around today - I think finding last years lecture will probably be the end 
result.

I know that execve() calls don't return on success, but I was under the impression that /usr/bin/sort 
always cats to stdout (unless piped elsewhere)? Which is why I'm unsure why the parent would need to 
process the output of sort.

It seems to me that if the object of the program is to print the sorted output to stdout, then the 
most logical way of doing that is to let /usr/bin/sort do that, rather than piping it back or storing 
it on disk and *then* printing. At which point if the parent has nothing to do, then the fork seems 
pointless?

Hi Thomas, 

For this unit, there is no definitive standard - except 'readability'. In that sense, I 
think something like tabs=4 spaces and making sure it is obvious where the loops start and 
end is perfectly fine. 

A rule of thumb I have had success with in the past is follow some of the conventions used 
in code examples in the lectures/labs - that might help with the control statement brackets, 
for example. 

We WILL be marking people on how the code "looks" and its readability, but not to the extent 
that we will be counting the number of spaces in indentations. 

Hope this helps.

Oh, I just had a thought immediately after writing this. If a process creates a pipe, and is then overwritten, is 
that pipe destroyed immediately or is it buffered? If that's the case, then I suppose the parent process needs to 
hang around just to keep the pipe open so that /usr/bin/sort can read from it.

On a similar note, is $TMPDIR wiped when a process is overwritten?

 From the unix sort manual the default option of sort is to output to stdout, you can
look at man sort to see how to output otherwise. It might be worth looking at the full
project specs to see why fork might be handy otherwise.

I don't think you don't have to sort by MAC and vendor names. Your list just needs to 
output the list by number of bytes sent (or received) in descending order.

Yeah it's pretty common sense that would be a requirement, otherwise it's just inconsistent and
difficult to mark effectively/efficiently (especially with an automated marking script)

Hi, 2 questions firstly: 
1. To solve the first requirement I've employed the use of creating a pipe and using 
awk, and then plan to later use fork(), execv(), and sort to fulfill the assignment 
requirements. Are there any issues with this method? Just making sure. 

2. For the output, are we required to output to a text file the program creates, or 
does our output get printed to the shell? And also, is a tab-space required between 
transmitter/receiver address and cumulative data? (I'm assuming output is being 
marked by a machine).

Much regards

Yeah Jesse, I was having a think and if you're piping some input to sort then maybe the parent needs to stay open to 
pipe the data through.

It sounds like you are using awk to pre-filter the data, then pipe it into a c program 
using a bash script(?) and then you will call the /usr/bin/sort through fork()/execve()? 

I would question this approach as being "legal", because I do not know exactly how you 
are calling awk/piping things around. Remember; the only thing we will be running is 
your compiled program, which is a single C source program that reads in the sample 
packets file. 

If you could explain further what you mean by this approach, either here (in a high-
level approach so you do not give too many things away), or to my email address (you can 
find me on the student email directory), I should be able to give you a more definitive 
answer.

I refer to this link here: 
http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/projects/project1-clarifications.php. 

This provides you with access to an executable that contains sample functionality based 
on the requirements listed in the project outline. You need to replicate this output (is 
it in a file, or printed to the shell?). This should also answer your tab-space 
question. 

Hope this helps,

I'll have another go at explaining it, let me know if this is still insufficient.
I'm opening a pipe directly to the awk bash command, and using fgets to read each line into a 
char array, which I can then print to shell/a temp file. After closing the pipe, then 
employing fork() and execv() to sort the final results. The program doesn't require anything 
more than the two parameters passed to the function at the beginning, such as extra input 
parameters for awk to function. It would be possible to combine the awk and sort into a 
single bash command which I could the pipe to, but that doesn't fulfil the project 
requirements.

I was wondering if anyone can help, I am trying to pass the following arguments to sort 
using execv() 

"-t" "$'\t'" "-rnk2" "stats.txt"

These work directly from the terminal to sort the text file, however when trying to pass 
them through my function the $'\t' doesn't go through correctly, I assume this is because I 
am trying to pass the separator \t.

Anyone got any tips how to navigate this problem?

Hi,

Is there a limit for the number of bytes that can be associated with any given 
packet?

The reason why knowing this limit is useful is because it would give the max length 
of each line of the packets text file, and without knowing it, each line of the 
packets.txt file could be indefinitely long (if the number of bytes field contains an 
arbitrarily large number of many digits).


Thank you.

Looks like I may be in the same boat too.
I've pretty much finished the program, all I'm stuck on is getting the arguments into the sort 
call.

Happy to have someone jump on board to review what I've done and hopefully provide insight into 
the last step.

put yourself in the directory of the text files once you've downloaded them,
or know exactly the path to the files, but easier if you work from their directory
and run the sample solution from the full /cslinux/bin path and can just refer to the files
from their name only :)

It's not too hard to find ways to work around this, and also it is probably

Hi

I'm still finding it difficult in sorting the function. From my understanding, we use the 
fork() to check if the process has errors or not, and eventually makes parent and child 
process. From there, if it has no error, it should then invoke the sort function, right? 
And once the child process is done, it must be reported back to the parents process and to 
finish the sorting process?

I am still not sure which execv to use for in order to open the sort function, and also a 
bit lost regarding the sort function itself (on how it operates, whether to treat it as a 
regular function and just put inputs into it or something else).

Really need help!

Thanks in advance!!

execve takes 3 parameters, the program called, the command line arguments to the program, and
the environment. The latter two are arrays of string literals, one of which is just NULL I think
for this purpose. Experiment with sort on your command line and use "man sort" to figure out more
of what you'll need to do :)

Thanks for clarifying. So i have read the manual, and from what i understand, the sort must 
read from a text file to sort it? So does it mean we have to put the addresses and the 
bytes that has been summed up together (not yet sorted), into a single text file and then 
use sort to do its thing? 

Cheers

You are right - C will take the '\t' character in a string and parse that as a tab, regardless of 
how many quotation marks you put around it. 

You can escape slashes using an extra backslash; e.g. '\\t' should print '\t'.

Hi, I was hoping for clarification on this:

"If your program encounters a broadcast MAC address, your program should ignore that 
input line."

Does this mean I ignore the entire line. So even if we are collecting data on 
transmitters, if it transmitted the broadcast address we ignore it?

Yes, as far as I'm aware that is the case. I had to re-do a section of my code as I was 
collecting transmitter data of a packet that was sent to the broadcast address, which I 
missed because I wasn't collecting the receiving address.

The sample solution appears to not ignore lines which have a broadcast address as the 
receiver when collecting data on transmitters. Is this intended?

After further testing against the sample solution, I've found it does in fact not consider the 
whole line if a broadcast MAC is seen. It appears that that sample solution only ignore the 
broadcast MAC for transmitter queries if is in the form ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff (ie no capitalisation 
or hyphens) but always ignores broadcast MACs (irrespective of form) for receiver queries.

The question was, "an interrupt service routine is:", and the answer was,

"an instruction sequence executed by the operating system to service an interrupt."

Shouldn't it have said, "an instruction sequence executed by the PROCESSOR to service an 
interrupt. 

Because it does say in the lecture 8 notes, page 7, that "when the timer interrupt occurs, 
the PROCESSOR will begin execution of the interrupt handler." 

And according to wikipedia, 'interrupt handler' and 'interrupt service routine' are 
interchangeable terms - "an interrupt handler, also known as an interrupt service 
routine..." 
 From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt_handler

Would appreciate clarification if I'm misunderstanding something here.

try passing it in the arg list as the flag "-t\t"... it should be recognised as the tab character but
in the way you want

I've been doing a lot of reading and testing, and I think for the purposes of this assignment we *technically* wouldn't 
need to fork to get the output we're looking for, but it seems like it's generally considered bad practice to exec without 
forking. Keeping the parent around allows us to monitor the child exec'd process to ensure it completed successfully, and 
perhaps to clean up or retry if it fails.

As far as anonymous pipes go, I believe they stay open until they're no longer linked to a file descriptor, but they can 
only hold so much in their buffer (something like 16-128KiB depending on how the system is configured?) before they block. 
As long as you're not shifting much data, even without forking you could probably do some nasty stuff like:

int fd[2];
pipe(fd);
fprintf(fd[0], "format", ...); // writing to the input of the pipe
dup2(fd[1], 0); // duping the output of the pipe to stdin
execv();

I haven't been able to test this myself yet, but I have to imagine that FDs remain when a process is exec'd. If they 
weren't, I'm pretty sure you'd never be able to pipe to stdin (e.g. using | in bash) without root permissions?

For this purposes of this project I think we want to use "execv()", execve() is the raw system 
call, and there are a few different C library wrappers for it.

The differences between all the different wrappers are mostly just the way they handle arguments. 
Make sure you read the manual page for execv ("man execv" at the terminal), because it's 
different from the manual page for execve (This confused me for a long time).

There's also a man page for sort which describes how it works (it's actually surprisingly 
powerful and can sort lines of text by collums etc). If you're unsure how you can try mocking up 
a text file and then running sort on it directly to figure out what arguments you need to then 
feed into execv() to get it to play nice.

Thanks a lot for that,it really helps. So i assume we need to create a new file to put our accumulated outputs 
to put in the sort argument? (since the sort function accepts a text file, not an array). And if so, would we 
better choose to make a temporary file?

Execv is actually simpler thane execve which is cool. But also, you can create a new file or you can use pipes.
Advice would be file since they're super easy

my args list but nothing seems to work.

Does anyone have any ideas?

that behaviour would suggest to me that you're setting -t\t fine as a argument to sort,
but whatever you're sorting might be missing the necessary information for \t to delimit
and it's using the last resort comparison to sort your date (sorting left column default way)!

I noticed in the output samples that the packet information from the same vendor is 
summed, even when the device ID is different:

00:8e:f2:c0:13:cc	951
84:1b:5e:a8:bf:7f	929
84:1b:5e:a8:bf:7c	259
74:e2:f5:17:96:89	138

84:1b:5e	NETGEAR	1188
??:??:??	UNKNOWN-VENDOR	951
74:e2:f5	Apple	138

The UNKNOWN-VENDOR address is shown here as ??:??:??, but in the input source we can 
actually see what it is, e.g. 00:8e:f2

So the question is - do we sum all UNKNOWN-VENDOR packets into the same line, or do we 
keep each UNKNOWN-VENDOR separate, and group them by their actual MAC?

(I can't seem to run the sample files via SSH so I can't verify the sample solution 
right now).

I'm baffled, -t$'\t' -k3 -rn foo.txt works in terminal, but 
"-t\t", "-k3", "-rn", "foo.txt", NULL doesn't work within execv.
By bad data does that mean a problem from the text file or a problem with the args i'm 
passing? Cheers

Fixed. For anyone who ran into the same issue execv should take your arguments as execv(args[0],

I am trying to implement the rule given by the project - 
"If the data totals of two or more MAC addresses, or two or more vendors (via their OUIs), 
are identical, then the MAC addresses or vendors with identical totals should be printed in 
ascending alphabetical order."

Reading 'man sort' and various web searches has led me to believe this string should work 
perfectly- 

sort -t $'\t' -rnk3,3 -fk2,2 output.txt

However I've created several unique text files with different data and can't get it to sort 
by column 2 alphabetically after sorting by column 3

Anyone got any tips?

Thanks!

Try adding the -d flag (--dictionary-order) for the second field. 

I believe the sort field, when specified by a delimiter (or by default), will include all
characters including punctuation, whitespace etc. So by including the -d flag it should sort
only on alphanumeric characters.

Alternatively you could try adding the -i flag (--ignore-nonprinting) which will ignore
whitespace... but I think this may be overridden if -d is present.

Don't know if this will help but worth a shot!

Can we use some additional C library functions in our solution? I found some of this 
stuff searching on Google. It seems to be available and compiles fine, and makes it 
easier to focus on the actual problem.

strcpy
strtok
sprintf

That's basically it, but execv() expects a pointer-to-a-char-array (char *args[]), not a char-array 
(char args[]).

It helps to keep in mind that when you use an array as an argument it decays to a pointer to the first 
element. So an argument of type (char args[]) will decay to type (char *args) and type (char *args[]) 
will decay to type (char **args).

Yep, we should be able to use any library as long as it compiles on the iMacs in the lab. 
So basically anything in the C99 standard library should be fine. If we couldn't import 
<string.h> this assignment would be a nightmare haha.

You can basically assume any of the C99 headers here are avaliable: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library

But, you'll also probably need to use <unistd.h> which is where all the POSIX syscalls 
are.

Just to clarify, anything in the header table on that page that *isn't* explicitly labeled as 
"C11" should be avaliable in C99.

I've been trying to remote login to the UWA CSSE network via SSH, but I haven't 
actually been able to connect. I was following the instructions here: 
http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/imacs-via-internet.php

I can request an SSH-channel to the UGGP gateway machine, but when it asks for a 
password I'm always declined. Do we need to get special permissions to log in this 
way or am I just missing something simple? I'm pretty sure it's not my password, 
because I've tried several times, and I use it to access plenty of other UWA 
services.

I'm on a linux machine, and as far as I know I should be able to connect with:

>$ ssh poster003@uggp.csse.uwa.edu.au

If this is correct can someone else give this a go and see if it works for them?

After much experimenting, I realised that the ? character appears at the end for command line arguments 
that have 20 characters in it. But still, could someone kindly tell me if there is a inbuilt function 
to get around this?

Hello,

As Ryan has indicated, do not use awk (or any other language called externally)
As the project must be written in C99.

All of those functions are from the standard C99 library so it's actually highly desirable
To use them instead of your own code.

I'm connecting using PuTTY on windows, and when it requests a password my UWA Pheme 
password works. Maybe double check what domain you're connecting to (I think thats the

I have completed the project but I am having trouble with the requirement of 
supporting the 90 character limit for Vendor Name as an individual item. 

Essentially the way I have written the code it is not really required as a stand alone 
item/number unless the Vendor Name represents the entire line of the OUI file.  

My current interpretation was --> OUI(8 char) + tab space (1 Char) + Vendor Name (90 
char) + newline (or whatever) = 100 chars per OUI line.  This means I read the line to 
99 characters stopping at the new line which leaves 90 as irrelevant.

Given that we can use this data and just append/replace the count on the end to get 
the required output it is easier to extend this and make string 120 length to include 
OUI, Vendor Name, Byte Count and tab spacing.  

I notice however that the max value of an output line in the example is 78 characters  
maybe this is supposed to be the max 90 not the 120?

Am I interpreting the 90 character Vendor Name the wrong way?

I take it you have these lines of the OUI file in an array of strings. What if you split up the 
OUI's and their vendor name into two different character arrays? Then you could treat them 
individually but each OUI would have the same index number as its corresponding vendor in the 
other array.

I am worried if I misunderstand this requirement.

"maximum number of distinct MAC addresses - 500. "

there can be two options.
1.there are 500 rows of each transaction(time/transmitter MAC/ receiver MAC /time)

2.there are anyway 500 distinctive MAC Address(whether is transmitter or receiver)
 but we never know the number of combination of the 500MAC


by the way I do not under stand why We have to check this.
even if there are just ten distinctive MAC address the number of
row in the input data can be over million given time.

This is to help you with choosing the size of what data type you are choosing to store 
the distinct MAC addresses. For example, if you are storing each distinct mac address as 
a string in an array, you can assume the size of that array will only be 500 distinct 
elements long.

Where does that wifistats-sample-osx come from?

Since I am running /cslinux/bin/wifistats-sample r sample-packets.txt

does that mean it is in the code for wifistats-sample as an error?

There is no wifistats-sample-osx, as I just said to you.

wifistats-sample is one option, wifistats-osx is the other, run either, not some
compound name of both since that doesn't exist. Look at the directory!

Looks like the ascending alphabetical is required. The project page said:

'If the data totals of two or more MAC addresses, or two or more vendors (via their OUIs), 
are identical, then the MAC addresses or vendors with identical totals should be printed in 
ascending alphabetical order.'

Global variables, declared outside of all functions, are initiated with zeroes.
In (nearly) all other cases, variables are not automatically initialised.

I see. Is this perhaps a sign that I should be declaring such an array outside of main ?

You should define variables so that the functions that need the variable can access it.
If outside of main, then all following function can (accidentally?) access it.

A good rule of thumb is that the sample solution output is the desired output, order 
and all.
However, a closer examination of the project brief may help to clarify things:
"The goal of this project is to write a C99 program, named wifistats, that reports 
the number of bytes either transmitted or received by devices using WiFi. The 
program may be requested to generate reports sorted by either the device MACs or by 
the vendors' names, from the largest transmitter (most bytes transmitted) to the 
smallest."

This implicates that, after sorting by the total bytes transmitted/received, one 
should then sort by MAC address or Vendor name (Depending on the mode of operation).

I got the same error. I feel like wifistats-sample is a wrapper for the actual program, which has a Linux and 
OSX version. In the directory, you can ls and see that there are indeed osx and linux versions, except they 
are named differently from the error message.

So - instead of running wifistats-sample, just run the wifistats-osx one directly. That seemed to work for me.

Yes it's a wrapper script - you can read it.
It's best to just run wifistats-sample then you don't have to care what platform your on.

Hi Chris,

In the project description it says you need to pass the arguments as so - 

./wifistats r sample-packets sample-OUIfile-small

This being the case I coded my program to convert this to a string with .txt on the end to 
open the correct file.

However when compared to the sample it gives different outputs.  I believe it's because of 
the following.

If you run 
/cslinux/bin/wifistats-osx t sample-packets (The comparison test file)
it says it's unable to open the file

However if you run
/cslinux/bin/wifistats-osx t sample-packets.txt
It runs perfectly

I removed the line in my code that adds the .txt, compiled and ran as

./wifistats r sample-packets sample-OUIfile-small.txt

And the test program says that the outputs now match.

Is this a problem with the test code?  
Just seeking some clarification on how this will be marked because my original code works 
for the project description but the altered code works for testing.

No program can open a file for reading if the file does not exist.
A file named blah is a differenf file to one named blah.txt
Under Unix-based systems, the filename extension is irrelevant and unecessary (you can use vi to 
create blah.doc but that doesn't make it a Word document).

I understand this, my question relates to the way we run the code.

The project says to use
./wifistats r sample-packets sample-OUIfile-small
However, the provided code on the CSSE computers seems to require us to run it using
./wifistats r sample-packets sample-OUIfile-small.txt

I had coded it to add the .txt so the file can be opened and thus letting me pass in the argument 
"sample-OUIfile-small" without the need for .txt

If you're using a pipe to get your data to sort (which is not necessary/beyond this project). 
then you probably have that bit wrong.

Your statement above is not correct.
You can run the sample solution with one or two files with any names.
There is no need to add a .txt to either.

Subject: IMPORTANT: Reading in the filename
From: poster014@student.uwa.edu.au
X-smilie: none
X-img: none

Hi all, 

Something that has confused a lot of people in the project is the way you are 
expected to read in a file. 

fopen does NOT require a file to have '.txt' appended at the end of it. The reason 
why the example instructions give:

    $./wifistats r sample-packets

And not

    $./wifitstats r sample-packets.txt

Is simply because the file has been saved onto the demonstration machine as 
"sample-packets". Not "sample-packets.txt". 

NOTE: If you are concatenating ".txt" every time you read in a file in your code, 
this will cause errors when we test it, as you will be adding a '.txt' to the 
filename when that filename might already have '.txt', and thus it won't exist. 

If you pass a file name to the program that does not exist on the computer, it will 
not work. Because it shouldn't work. If you have the file saved as "sample-
packets.txt", passing in "sample-packets" as an argument won't work if you don't 
also have that file on our computer - this is expected. 

Hypothetically, we should be able to give you a sample file, with MAC addresses in

If you're storing the results in a file, you have to fclose it before you excecute sort on that 
file. This had me up until 2am last night :/

Hi, 

I was wondering if there would be any scenario where the bytes column would contain
a number less than 1. I'm currently using a function where passing 0 as the number
of bytes results in a different action to passing a non-zero number of bytes (so 0
being passed makes the function act as though the mac address passed is a vendor OUI
and non-zero is an actual packet), and I was wondering if I needed to change this.

Thanks
Tom

While all lengths will be positive, I suggest changing your design a bit.
Perhaps pass an extra Boolean parameter or return a Boolean result,
to achieve the same result in a clearer way.

Hi thanks for the replies.

1) I am not using a 'pipe' of any sort as i have no idea what that is :P

2) Thanks so much for the suggestion. I just tried this but it still is not displaying my sort results to 
the screen.


Were there any other suggestions? I am also calling printfs before and after my execv() (which calls 
/bin/sort) and they are outputting fine!

Bit frustrating as I can't find anything online about this :(

If you're seeing any printfs *after* an execv, it means the execv call is failing, and sort is never running.

Thanks for the reply.

My understanding of execv is that the first parameter takes the path as a string to the program to call (in this case, 
sort) and the second parameter is a NULL pointer terminated array of arguments for the program. And by convention the 
first element on this array should be the name of the program?

Could there be something wrong with the way im handling the child process? (where i store the return value of fork, and 
only execute the execv if the returned process ID = 0?)

I have just tested using 'ls' with the '-1' flag and it worked completely fine with output displaying to the terminal etc..

Could it be that I am using incorrect flags when calling sort, or is sort not located in /bin/sort ?? (I have tested with these flags

Well the alternative approach that my partner and I have come up with involves the 
use of global variables (which is often considered bad practice, unless absolutely 
necessary). While it is clear that repetitive code can cause problems when 
debugging/modifying code, our alternative approach also has its issues. Having said 
that, it seems that removing duplicate code may be the better option.

I am not sure what is happening here, but it looks like you might opening a file every time you 
read a line, and failing to close it?

Perhaps post an excerpt of your code?

As you can see that on the right, my code works fine with the small packets file, but when it run with the 
larger one, it print (cant open file: Too many open files). and i am pretty sure i closed my file after i 
used it and fopen is not in a loops.

if that's your code for the reading the input (it seems to be), are you also writing a file to output for sort to read?
it might be you've opened that one in a loop...?

I am trying to code my program to take the 90 character name, however I have run into 
strange problem.

I edited the oui-sample-large file so that Routerboard.com is now the following name -

11111111112222222222333333333344444444445555555555666666666677777777778888888889999999999

This is a 90 character name.

However when I read this is using strncpy or by iterating over the line elements I get the 
same problem.

This line is read as - 

1111111111222222222233333333334444444444555555555566666666667777777777
9999999999

In essence elements 71-80 have been read as '\n', which is strange indeed.

Any advice or reasoning behind this?

Narrowed the problem to the fact that using

while(fgets(line, sizeof line, oui) != NULL)

always gives a sizeof line = 80 even if there are more characters in the line, is this a text editor 
problem?

If so can we have a test file with a Name field of 90 characters to test against our solution?

You *need^ totell fgets your array size.

You can easily create your own test files or test with a shorter vendor length.

fgets is only working for me entering a manual value up to a length of 88 (even though the line is 100 chars)
(ie while(fgets(line, 88, oui) != NULL))  
before it gives an Abort Trap 6, which is 12 short of the needed 100 characters on a line with a 90 character 
vendor name.

I've been having issues with truncating the OUI vendor name to remove whitespace,
I've managed to do it successfully using the null byte for other parts of the program.

Basically this procedure:
> Isolates the name
> Reads it into a string of size [91] character by character, incrementing a counter
each time
> upon reaching the end of the line reading, adds a null byte at the index of the
counter.

This procedure works perfectly for other parts but fails to truncate the name
meaning when it prints the whitespace aswell so the byte size is force printed on
the next line instead of the same line.

Any ideas greatly appreciated, cheers.

I'm having difficulty understanding your explanation (force printed??)
But look at the trim() function fron lectures.

Hi,

I was just wondering if testing for errors such as unable to open files, write files, 
fork/execve failing etc will be tested as part of the specifications of the project?

If so will the way that our program handles these situations will be compared to the sample 
program? i.e. The message printed by perror including errno.

I know that I can test some of these errors with the sample, but I was just thinking about 
fork and execve failing and how could we replicate that.

Thanks

What do you mean by 'white space' here?

* Spacebar?
* Tab?
* New line?

I guess it's a new line char you are trying to remove. Can you check exactly which chars 
are being put into that 91 length string of yours? 

If there is a new line then there must be a '\n' in there somewhere. What are you 
truncating the line on? '\0'? Or maybe '\t'?

Yes, these will absolutely be tested and looked at/for, as their support in your project is an

Will that component of msrking only be part of the human marked component as a significant part of 
good coding practice? Or will our error messages have to be identical to the sample solution?

Yes (from memory) all such errors should be treated as fatal.

So the only errors we need to check for are:

Reading/writing to files
Forking
Execv'ing

Correct? Because it says we can assume all the input never exceeds the limits. Ie, we don't 
need to check if our distinct mac address is full.

My code runs fine for everything, but when I tried running from the large OUI sample file 
instead of the smaller one , it crashed with the abort 6 error message, any ideas why?

When i run /cslinux/bin/test-wifistats  to test my program, it says the output is different 
but there is no visible difference in output. Below is a snippet output from diff from the 
sample and my program. I can't see any difference in the output? 

I'm assuming this may be because of white space or something?

There's serious reasons why you shouldn't broadcast solutions to parts of projects.

While testing my program, I have just come to a realization that I have no idea how 
big of a sum our program is expected to deal with. Does anybody know? The main reason 
I want to know is should we be expecting data totals greater than the value a regular 
32-bit int type can hold? If so, I will have to run back and change a few things. 

Thanks for the help.

Just use ints  (and previously answered).
And don't assume that longs are necessarily longer than ints.

no. The file name is put into the command line. If the file has .txt it will be in command

I take it you are using putty? By doing complete loops, it'll be around that. However for 
me, the exact same code takes only 2 seconds on cygwin. If you are on a local macOS 
machine, that's very interesting.

Indeed. I've reduced it to about 30 seconds though. 
It's the processing of the packet line which is doing it. Though I'm sure I'm not doing anything 
wasteful. I've tried both sscanf and strtok and they give take about the same time. Perhaps it's 
writing to globals rather than parameters that's doing it? Like maybe globals don't get loaded onto 
the CPU registrar or something. I don't know. Will we get marked down for taking too long?

30 seconds does seem *long-ish*, but it is difficult to tell exactly why without seeing it in run.

I would try running this on the macOS machines to see if there is any difference in performance - 
especially given we shall be compiling and marking the code on those machines. 

I doubt it is globals affecting your performance in this context; it is most likely looping or 
conditionals that will result in longer run-times for an assignment like this. 

Provided the run time of the code is not in the order of minutes - i.e. if it's spitting out the right 
answer, but only after 15 minutes of computing, there is definitely something wrong - I would suggest that 
there would be no marks lost in the "automated testing" scenario, provided the output is correct. However, 
when we look through the code for readability and good programming practise, we might find design flaws 
that are contributing to the run time, and mark accordingly. 

I would suggest for your situation, checking it on a Macintosh ASAP is the best idea, and not to stress if 
it is still taking 30-ish seconds. :) 

Cheers, 

Ryan [Lab guy]

Well I'm running it on my clunky MacBook Pro so hopefully that's a factor. Here are the specs:

MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012)

2.9 GHz Intel Core i7

8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3

Reckon this is slowing it down?

Are you reading into a variable that does not have enough "space"? 
e.g. array is only 50 elements long and you want 600?

I'm not too sure, I've been using printf to find where the execution is crashing, and it seems to

Double check the size of the array you are reading into, and perhaps check to make sure there is room 
for all characters in the string.

^^ Unfortunately this is only helpful in predicting performance when I have access to your code. I 
can't help much more in that regard, I'm afraid.

Other things that to look out for:
    Arrays that are excessively large.
    Null bytes on the end of character arrays (Make sure they're there).

Also, when tracking down Abort Traps or Segmentation Faults, fprintf to stderr is much more reliable.

I know, right? 00:00 is the absolute best time to debug C code!

In all seriousness though, 30 seconds is probably alright. If it's over a minute for

It looks as if you have answered your own question here. If you encounter the broadcast MAC address, 
ignore the line. Given your assumption the broadcast MAC address will never be in the transmitter 
column, what does this mean for you?

Please look at lecture 12, which provides an overview of how to use fork() and execv(). 
Pay attention to the newargs parameter of execv(). 


I would suggest looking up how /usr/bin/sort works, and test it on the command line to 
get a feel for how it can be used.

I'm aware that the address will never be in the transmitter address in any VALID input, I'm wondering if a 
specific behaviour is required of the program when handling INVALID inputs that do have this address in the 
transmitter column.

hello

So me and my partner won't be able to complete the project...
so i was curious what we should do, our question 1 works, and nearly have our sort working, 
however for question 2, we have written up some of the code but it doesn't work. 

Should we include everything we have done or leave out part 2? what would help us get a 
higher mark?

Thanks

Uh, I remember I had this problem two. Turns out there were two cslinux directories 
on the machine, and one of them did not have the file.

Can you pwd can confirm that it is /cslinux/bin? Here is my output from ssh:

ecm-csse2109-x:bin poster042$ cd /cslinux/bin/
ecm-csse2109-x:bin poster042$ pwd

ecm-csse2109-x:bin poster042$ ls | grep wifi
test-wifistats
wifistats-linux
wifistats-osx
wifistats-sample

The files are definately there, maybe try a different machine.

Submit as much code as you've written, even if it doesn't work in all cases. Just don't submit 
something that crashes in all cases.
You're able to use the UWA Assessment policy to submit late, for a small penalty, if you consider 
that worthwhile.

Welp, maybe this is a bit late, but as David said, have you considered breaking up the 
code into functions?

You avoid a ton of duplicate code this way. Just turn anything that is repeated (or even 
that does something different) into a function. You don't need global variables either 
because you can just pass the variables as paramters from one function to the next.

I recommend to check out this book by Uncle Bob (he's also got a great video series) if 
you want some good techniques for writing code: https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-
Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882

The examples are in Java but the concepts are relevant to any coding language.

I have 2 questions about this week's lab. Here is a function from the solutions:


char *strcat_a(char dest[], char src[])
{
    char        *orig   = dest; //Is this equivalent to: char *orig = &dest[0] ?
    int         d=0, s=0;

    while(dest[d] != '\0')
    {
        ++d;
    }
    while(src[s] != '\0')
    {
        dest[d] = src[s];
        ++s;
        ++d;
    }
    dest[d]     = '\0';

    return orig;
}

1. Why don't we get an "array index out of bounds" error, since dest is an array 
(therefore has fixed length), and we go past the end of it by first going to the 
end of it, and then continually doing ++d ?

2. We return orig, which is a pointer to the first element of dest (which is a char 
array). Therefore, isn't this saying that the function returns the first letter of 
the final concatenated string?

You are conflating the 'end of a string' with the 'end of an array' - they are not the
same thing.

If I declare and initialise an array as follows: 

    char temp[50];
    strcpy(temp,"Hello");

The '\0' character will be at temp[5], as it is the 6th element of the string "Hello".
However - the array is still 50 characters long in memory; we have room for 44 more
characters! The sample solution finds the null byte, which is the point at which we can
start concatenating the elements from the src array into the rest of the dest array. 

An index out of bounds error may occur if you attempt to copy from a src array that has
more elements than dest - but as a programmer, you should make sure you know what you're
copying into what!

This is almost correct - we are returning a **pointer** to the first element of the
final concatenated string. You will find a lot of the time we do not assign the return
value of these pointers to anything.

Sort of paraphrasing Ryan's answer: the nature of the standard strcat() function - see man 
strcat - is that there must already be a string in the destination array, and we're 
appending a new string to the end of the original.

It's also assumed (required for correct operation) that the provided destination array is 
long enough to hold both the original string, the newly appended string, and a single null-
byte.  If we're concerned that the destination array might not be long enough, then we 
should use strncat() instead.

I missed the timing to fill in the survey about the project, but just thought
I'd say something having read some of the feedback.

I did the project alone, and I thought that as someone with a moderate programming background,
the project was a good difficulty, if you planned it out beforehand, and if you didn't
wait until the last minute. I found that I almost completed it on the first weekend it
was available without it being a rush, and that the time I spent overall working on
the project was not excessive. I think a major issue for people who struggled may have been
not starting early, and assuming the project was something that could be done in one week
with no stress.
Personally, my only issue was that it was unclear what processes were allowed
(such as creating a file), however with file creation allowed, the project I agree was
wholly completable with weeks 1-6 of content.

Overall I found it really enjoyable and to be a good assessment of the content
covered so far in the unit.

In addition, about the labs and forum for the project, my lab was taken by Trent and I found him to be a good
help when I had questions, and I observed that most of the important questions about
the project were clearly and well described on the forums, or people were pointed to
the relevant part of the project description.

Hope the feedback is appreciated!

I would have to agree, I also did the project alone with moderate experience and found it to be achievable whilst
still posing a good challenge. I think this was a well designed project and reasonably covered the content taught
as well as what I believe should be prior knowledge and practices for a second year programming unit. I found
this project enjoyable and felt the requirements were clearly specified, the sample output provided I found was
very helpful and reduced ambiguity of the projects intended operation (an issue I've found in some previous units).

The function names, such as strcat_p() and strcat_a(), are not part of the C standard and, 
so, there's no standard header file for them.
So, yes, the declarations you've provided are correct ones to place in your own header file.

You only need to #include any of the standard C header files if you use their features.
For example, if your own code *doesn't* use a bool, then you don't need <stdbool.h>
In addition, if any of the standard C header files, themselves, require the use of a bool, 
then those header files will #include <stdbool.h> themselves.

And a note on terminology - they're called the standard header files; they are not the 
standard libraries, but declare things which are defined and implemented in the standard 
libraries.

The file contents look OK, provided those big indents are made with tabs.

Running  make  will only run the first target in a Makefile.
Are you actually running:    make clean
to get your result?

Sorry, I spoke too quickly, while focusing on the 'clean' target.

The Makefile contents *don't* look OK - the way it's written, if any of the C source of header 
files are modified (more recently than that file st.o), then *all* of the C files will be 
recompiled.

The intention of using a Makefile is not simply to save typing, but to only undertaken the 
minimal effort (compilations) to rebuild the whole project.

By the way, why do we delete the executable and the object files? I thought the point of the makefile was 
so that you didn't have to make a new copy of the executable if nothing has changed. But if the executable 
is deleted then we will have to make a new copy of it anyway.

It's just a convenient (and accurate) way to cleanup up your directory of 'unwanted' files.
For example, I'll generally do a 'make clean' in a directory to reduce space before doing a backup, or saving the 
directory's important files to Dropbox, etc.
As we're using a Makefile, we can always create those files again, when needed.

The project's input and output are only character-based,
so you can login to either a CSSE Mac or a Linux machine by following the instructions on our 
unit's homepage (left-hand margin).

Also, I wouldn't 100% rely on this, but I think the linux subsystem (beta) for windows10
with Bash on Ubuntu on Windows works for testing code to work like on a unix machine.

I was able to use this a lot for the sake of my first project, and use it for any extra
c or c++ code I do at home. It gives you access to the linux manuals and commands through
bash.

I don't have time to go into the labs either because of work, and I own a Windows 10 PC. But assuming you have a 
PC with reasonable specs, you should be able to get Linux up and running within the hour, and for $0.00 cost.

Here are some different options:

1. Install Ubuntu Bash for Windows 10 (Ubuntu is a 'version' of Linux). This is the easiest option and it gives 
you Linux terminal that you can use directly from Windows OS. Read: https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-
install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/

2. SSH into the UWA's iMacs and work from there (using bash, or Putty).

3. Install Ubuntu on a virtual machine on your PC. You can download the official Ubuntu image from 
https://www.ubuntu.com/ and a free VM from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-
storage/virtualbox/downloads/index.html

4. Got a spare USB drive? You could actually use that to boot into a native Linux OS to work on. You could 
literally attach it to your house keys and carry it around in your pocket. A USB drive these days will cost you 
less than a free-range chicken sandwich.

The Linux environment is good enough to work on the project, but you'll need to test your solution on the school 
iMacs via SSH before submiting. The SSH instructions are on the CITS2002 page (iMacs via Internet).

Good luck!

Hi,

I am still confused about the use of Makefile. I know the purpose of using it, but I am not 
sure about the usage.

I use the calcmarks from the lecture as an example. However, when I type "make" in the 
commandline of my Terminal, it gives me "make: *** No targets specified and no makefile 
found.  Stop." I am not so sure what is wrong.

Can someone explain it to me in more detail on how to use Makefile? From what i understand, 
i need to write the makefile as a textfile?

Thankss

Interesting;  for years Linux distributions haven't explicitly enforced POSIX declarations (and 
hence fileno had to be declared 'manually').  Times change!

Quickest solution is to remove the 'const' from the above line,
or just remove the whole line.

Hi Chris.

Are the marks available yet? Thought you said they'd been uploaded yesterday evening.

They are clearly not available yet.
Finished 'marking' about 11pm,
now applying lateness penalties, and 'hiding' results from those with academic misconduct concerns.
Bugging doesn't speed up the process :-)

The majority of students should now be able to see their 1st project mark in csmarks.

There were 183 submissions from 261 students - congratulations to the students receiving 35 / 40 or higher.

The (raw) average mark was 24.6 / 40, an improvement over last year's 1st project average of 23.1 / 40.

However, please note that the visible average is lower (21.2 / 40) because a number of submissions have been marked as 
'not available' and referred to the Faculty's Academic Conduct Advisor.
39 students received a penalty for a late submission.

- If your mark is recorded as 'not available' (18 students) you'll receive an email from me shortly.

- If your mark is recorded as 'not submitted' (38 students), and you believe that you made a project submission, please 
look for it in cssubmit (perhaps mistakenly in another unit?), or ask your project partner because they may have 
incorrectly recorded your student number - then email me with some details.

Otherwise, check your mark, your feedback sheet, and if there's any concerns about either please email me by

  *** WEDNESDAY 25th OCTOBER.

_____
Just to clarify - the automated section of the marking was performed by comparing the output of your project against 
the output of the sample solution (for which you now have the source code).  A subset of each of the provided sample 
test files was used.  

Before the comparison, any MAC addresses in your output were converted to lowercase, and all hyphens converted to 
colons.  Partial marks were awarded for comparisons that almost matched - if the outputs matched identically, you 
received full marks for that test;  if the outputs matched after all whitespace was removed you lost only 1 mark; if 
the outputs matched once it was sorted you lost only 1 mark.

If your project crashed (a signal terminated its execution) while running a particular test, or if your project took 
longer than 30seconds to complete any test, then you received no marks for that test.

____
And a big thanks to both Trent and Ryan, who did a great (and quick) job with the manual inspection
of the project submissions.

I have spoken to a few people about the marking for project 1 and found that marks were 
deducted for not using wait when piping sort output to parent. In this scenario wait 
cannot be used as otherwise the child process will fill the pipe and then hang, causing 
both processes to hang.

Wrong. If you use wait you prevent the program from exiting before your output is finished.
You should have tried changing where you put it.

To clarify if you don't wait then your parent will execit without guaranteeing the child was 
complete.

It's not wrong, if you are using a pipe and try to wait for the child to finish the pipe will fill up 
and the child will hang until the parent takes some output from the pipe. If the parent waits until 
the child closes the pipe (which it does) it guarantees the child was complete (well not entirely but  
it has no more output). In future I suggest being less blunt about something being wrong when you 
haven't understood the question properly.

I know wrong because: used pipes. Used wait. Process didn't hang. Do your research. You were clearly using 
wait in the wrong place.

To be more detailed: your wait shouldnt be before the psrent process does its work, you use wait before 
exiting the parent process.

A wait when exiting a parent process is unnecessary, as when the parent exits the children are removed from the 
process table automatically.

You understand that wait(NULL) waits for all child processes to complete...? If not try man waitpid on 
bash/terminal. You need to make the parent wait for the child to complte before exiting.

Orphaned processes are automatically waited on by init. See below:

Zombie processes should not be confused with orphan processes: an orphan 
process is a process that is still executing, but whose parent has died. 
These do not remain as zombie processes; instead, (like all orphaned 
processes) they are adopted by init (process ID 1), which waits on its 
children. The result is that a process that is both a zombie and an orphan 
will be reaped automatically.

You seem to be debating the properties and usage of wait, when your issue before was that it's impossible to use wait when outputing via sort after piping and forking.
It is 100% possible which leaves a few options:
a) you're misunderstanding something about the forking process, pipes, and why you need to wait
b) I have no idea what I'm talking about (likely) and my code was somehow a magic exception to the laws of computers (unlikely) and did impossible things
c) you think Chris, Ryan and Trent are vindictive enough to take marks away for something correct, or not bad practice,
d) you seem to think you know better than the aforementioned who have a lot of experience with this stuff, and that they believe in the impossible,
or e) linear combinations of the above.

It looks to me like your Makefile is not entirely correct. This error is suggesting that 
you are using to a function defined in another file, but not linking to the header file 
with that function's declaration.

I believe this discussion has become counter-productive to the OP's intention. I do not think any more replies are necessary in this thread. 

In this scenario, piping was not an explicit requirement of the project; as a result, we were looking to see if students were using correct practises when calling sort 
via execv, and making sure they are waiting for the process to finish. This is 'good practise', as it is possible to write code that uses a child process and works 
perfectly well without having the wait() in there; this is perhaps confirmed by the number of submissions we had that worked well enough to pass people's tests, but 
did not call wait(&status). 

It is also - from my understanding - possible to use wait() with a pipe. It is also entirely possible to use pipes and NOT require wait(), based on the inherent 
functionality of pipes. However, because we are not able to spend an awful lot of time reading into the logic of the code (this ostensibly being marked on the ability 
for it to deliver the right results to the auto-run marker), it is entirely possible we have taken the absence of a wait() call at face value, and not internalised the 
context for why it has not been called in this scenario. 

It is always good practise - at least, in university projects - to follow the techniques and ideas that have been presented in the lecture material and labs. It was 
discussed in the lectures that calling wait() was necessary, and is good practise, so that should have been an indication that it is necessary to do so (within the 
context of this assignment). 

At the end of the day, if you feel as if you have been marked down unfairly, please let us know.

This is probably because 'fileno' is a Posix feature...

What happens if you place:

    int fileno(FILE *stream);

IN one of your headers?

(Annoyingly) we're observing that the (many) different Linux distributions being used have different 
header files provided by their C compilers - e.g. see the project clarification of Oct 15th.

If using Linux, change lines near the top of your myshell.h header file to read:

#if defined(__linux__)
    extern      char    *strdup(const char *str);
    extern      int     fileno(FILE *fp);
#endif

so that your code will be aware of the existence of fileno() as an external function.
Under Linux, it appears to be declared in some distributions, but not others.

Resolved;  In case others see a similar problem -

the Makefile being developed *did not* have tab characters at the beginning of its 
command/action lines.

It *looked* like it did, because the text editor being used to edit the Makefile had been 
configured to replace a typed tab character with 4 space characters - something some editors 
to do to map between 'hard' and 'soft' tab characters to allow consistent indenting of 2, 4, 
6, .....  spaces.

Hi guys,

Today I just tried running the sample solution

When I invoke my own code, this is how i call:
./wifistats t sample-packets

I've created a small function which will automatically put ". txt" at the end of my file 
name. (Hard coded, which means ./wifistats t sample-packets.txt wouldn't work in my code)


But apparently, for the sample solution, it requires us to put in ".txt"
./wifistats t sample-packets.txt


My output works perfectly fine, got the same result as the sample solution, but I got 0 
marks for all, at the rubric for comparing results.

Will I still get marks for this?

Thanks

You may have reently emailed me about this, if so I'll reply soon,
but as was discussed in this forum many times, filenames did not require the .txt filename 
extension, or to have it appended to filenames.

Search for   .txt  and  extension
in this forum and you'll see over 20 articles such as this:

  https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help2002?p=np&a=226&all=y7

> Will I still get marks for this?

Cannot yet say; I suspect your code may have added the .txt extension, then just attempted to 
open the file (which may not exist), without checking the success of that request.

There was no requirement to read in the file and append a ".txt". In the sample command line 
arguments given in the Project 1 description, the file that was saved would have been "sample-
packets". NOT sample-packets.txt. The reason why it is only working on your machine when you run 
it as "sample-packets.txt" is because you have saved the file as "sample-packets.txt".

And to re-inforce Ryan's comment - many of the projects that I am re-looking at, after students' 
concerned emails, have the problem where they either require, or assume that all input files have an 
extension of ".txt",  some projects also trying to first add ".txt" to files without it.

Often, these projects crash if the required or assumed extension does not exist.  The result is is 
typically:

- the program crashes and produces no output, or
- the program was only ever tested with files having the extension.

So this morning you mentioned that && should take precedence over || just like 
multiplication takes precedence over addition.

Does this mean that in the command "a && b || c" the '||' will be the parent node, 
with ( a && b) on the left branch and c on the right? Or does it just parse from left to 
right, with '&&' being the parent node, with 'a' on the left branch and ( b || c ) on the 
other.


Or did you just mean that in the command "a || b && c", we will have ( b && c ) on the left 
branch and 'a' on the right branch instead of 'a' on the left and ( b && c ) on the right?

            exit(atoi(t->argv[1]));

Also are there only 2 exit statuses, 1 for failure and 0 for success?

The takeaway message from this morning's workshop was "please wait for an announcement as to whether 
I've modified the code for the parser".
However, this should not prevent you from thinking about, and undertaking other steps.

You'll need to remember/store the value somewhere.
The actual exit status is obtained via the argument to the wait() system call.

I think I have encountered the same problem as OP but I visited the forum occasionally for 
specific questions relating to the project (for example I needed help with sorting so I read a 
few posts on sorting) so I missed the post on text file extensions.

Hopefully this opinion is as unbiased as possible but I believe that we should be able to 
complete the project with the instructions + clarifications only and seek help with specific 
features in the forums (there were a lot of posts on various aspects of the project). I've only 
encountered text files before and the input files automatically had a .txt extension when I 
downloaded them from the project page so I inserted some code to add a ".txt" to the input file 
name.

So basically, I feel that the clarifications and instructions for the project would be necessary 
to complete the project, but the help forums are for helping out with features in the code (the 
type of file or lack of extension would be a clarification while trying to trim a line of input 
would be in the help forums, in my opinion).

Thank you for your time. =)

Thanks for your comment Nicholas,

I've been using the Clarifications page, if necessary, to clarify my wording on the main project sheet,
but not using it to correct and collate any individual misunderstandings of students if they raise questions 
about them on the help forum - hoping to avoid duplication.

We've also discussed the matter of filename extensions in lectures or a workshop, and both of those are 
appropriate additional sources of knowledge for the project.

I appreciate that some, but not all, browsers add the .txt extension to some downloaded files (personally, 
I'm unsure why they do that).  I can imagine those using browsers that don't add a .txt extension wondering 
to themselves why this is a question for discussion :-)

The make program first looks for a file named 'makefile', then for one named 'Makefile', 
to locate the specification it will use (to build your project).

If you *choose* to use any other filename, then you can run

   make -f anyotherfilename

For some reason, you've named your specification file 'makefile.make' (why?) and so make 
will use it iff you tell it to.  Otherwise make will not find either of the two files it 
looks for,

Whilst re-reading the lecture slides on dynamic memory allocation, I have a query. 
It says that malloc should be used when you don't know in advance how big your 
array needs to be, so they give this example code to illustrate:


char *my_strdup2(char *str)
{
    char *new = malloc( strlen(str) + 1 );

    if(new != NULL)
    {
        strcpy(new, str);   
    }
    return new;
}

That makes sense, but couldn't you just do this:


char *my_strdup2(char *str)
{
    int required_size = strlen(str) + 1;
    char *new[required_size];

    strcpy(new, str); 

    return new;
}

After doing some reading, I found that malloc is useful when you want your variable 
to actually exist AFTER the function has been executed...so is this the primary 
reason to use malloc?

The web program https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/myshell-display

Why you compile the above with   mycc -o try try.c
what does the compile think of it?

In English,  char *new[required_size]
is  "new is an array of RS pointers to characters" -
probably not what you wanted!

We cannot tell what you may have broken from your description.

The web program   https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/myshell-display
(which uses the same command parser as the starting materials)
accepts and displays commands with a semicolon,  suggesting you've broken something.

Hi,

I just wanted to know whether date monday (example on the sheet), will produce 0 or -1 when 
it is executed, because i am getting 0 (which indicate its a success and nothing is wrong), 
however the program does print out the result below when i give the input. (Because i am 
getting 0 from the "date monday", hence the ls command is executed.)

"date monday && ls
date: illegal time format

The 'date' command does not recognise/accept the argument 'monday',
so you'd be expecting that command to fail and to print an error message.

You can check this, and other commands by trying it in your standard shell:

prompt> date monday
 ... error message
prompt> echo $status
1


When you say "because i am getting 0", you're probably getting it from the wrong place/way?

Is the command that is to be timed by the time command supposed to be generic? 

If time ls (or any other external program) is called you can just execute the ls
program and print the time it took but if you call time ((cmd1 && cmd2) || cmd3),
for some arbitrary cmd's, then this is vastly more complicated.

The only way I can see this working is by forking the current process and passing
the arbitrary cmd's to the parse_shellcmd() function and then passing the resultant
SHELLCMD to the execute_shellcmd() function.

Am I way off the mark here or is this how the time command is to function? Any
advice would be much appreciated as I've been stuck on this for far too long now!

Thanks

I've been having trouble with trying to figure out how to redirect the I/O streams

can then be printed to stdout/any output area if needed with print_redirection. But 
with this, I wouldn't be able to modify stdin. The skeleton code seems to suggest 
something opposite instead where the checking of infile, outfile is done after 
execution? Which doesn't really make sense.

Is there a more efficient way to tackle this problem? It seem like I've been stuck on

I think dup2 lets you redirect stdout to outfile? Not 100% sure though, but
maybe looking at man dup2 and having a little experiment might work :)

My unbiased opinion would be:

I do not think it is fair to penalise huge amount of marks just based on the ".txt" extension.
I do visit forums and watch lectures/workshops. I might have missed this important point of you 
mentioning that saving file without the extension. 

My code works perfectly fine, I am able to get the correct results without the extension problem.
I think we deserve a second chance of and receive our marks according to the rubric. 

Thank you.

Subject: The precedence of shell operators
From: chris.mcdonald@uwa.edu.au
X-smilie: none

Please take a copy of the new  parser.c  file for our project, from

   http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/projects/parser.c

It is 11150 bytes long (and does not have a ".txt" extension!)
It is a 'drop-in' replacement for the older parser, and you should not
need to change the design or implementation of your existing work.

The starting materials and the web-based display program have been updated
to use this new parser.


-----------------------
Why?
As we know there are a number of shells available on Unix-based
platforms - including sh, bash, ksh, csh, tcsh, and zsh.  Each has a
similar syntax and operates similarly but, of course, the differences
are the very reason for having different shells.

Our area of discussion has been the precedence, and hence execution
order, of the operators '&&' and '||'.   As our project is wishing
to develop a subset of the features of the shell you use, sh or bash,
we'll follow its online manual entry:

    " A list is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by one of
      the operators ;, &, &&, or ||, and optionally terminated by one of
      ;, &, or <newline>.
      Of these list operators, && and || have equal precedence, followed
      by ; and &, which have equal precedence.  "

Great, a simpler solution required than worrying about the precendence
of '&&' and '||',  and good to clear things up.

We can see some of the differences between shells, and test our own
project's similarity to sh or bash with a simple test program and
experimenting with the order of operators.  Consider the C99 program:

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
        int status = (argv[0][0] == 's') ? EXIT_SUCCESS : EXIT_FAILURE;
        printf("%s\n", argv[0]);
        exit(status);
        return status;
    }

which simply prints its own name, and exits with success or failure
depending on the first character of its name. Make 6 copies of this program:

    cc -std=c99 -Wall -Werror -pedantic -o success1 filename.c
    cp success1 success2
    cp success1 success3
    cp success1 fail1
    cp success1 fail2
    cp success1 fail3

Most standard shells can execute commands provided as command-line arguments
(but not myshell).  Consider the execution of some commands under sh and csh:

    prompt>  sh  -c "./success1 || ./success2 && ./success3"
    ./success1
    ./success3
    prompt>  csh -c "./success1 || ./success2 && ./success3"
    ./success1

    prompt>  sh  -c "./success1 || ./fail2 && ./success3"
    ./success1
    ./success3
    prompt>  csh -c "./success1 || ./fail2 && ./success3"
    ./success1

Same commands, different results - but both are 'correct' because that's how
they're designed to perform.

Why was I confused about whether our standard shells have difference
precedence for '&&' and '||', considering them equivalent to the
Boolean operators of 'and' and 'or'?  I teach another Masters unit,
CITS4407 Open Source Tools and Scripting, where we look at shells in detail,
particularly their use as programming languages.  sh and bash support
other Boolean operators (not required for our project!),  requested by using
the operators  -a  and  -o  in tests, which *do* follow the expected Boolean
order of execution (yes, even in the same shell!):

    if [ expression1 -a expression2 -o expression3 ]    # etc....

Welcome to systems programming, and good luck remembering all the differences :-)

Subject: Decisions on concerns about 1st project marking
From: chris.mcdonald@uwa.edu.au
X-smilie: none

X-announcefor: 5d

If your 1st project submission:

  - assumed that the input files ended in ".txt",
  - required that the input files ended in ".txt",
  - renamed the provided input files so that they ended in ".txt"

then, I'm afraid, that your approach to using a program's specified input
files was incorrect.  If your approach to any of these points resulted
in your project not producing the correct output, then you will (have)
lost marks for it.

There is no wording or sample code in lecture notes, laboratory
sheets and solutions, or workshop questions and solutions, that
text files must have the ".txt" extension.  While the sample project
solution still works if you provide input filenames with the ".txt"
extension, it does not require or modify filenames to enforce it.
Moreover, the topic was discussed in over 25 articles on our help
forum while the project was running.

I have reviewed all 184 submissions, and only 21 have (clearly)
taken this approach, so I do not believe that it was a systemic
misunderstanding.  However, based on emails that I have received,
it appears that a number of other students have misunderstood the
issue.  If your project created a new (text) file holding data to
be passed to the sort program, and you gave the file an extension
of ".txt", then that is not a problem, and you lost no marks for that.

I will revisit the project submission in which the above error may
have resulted in your losing marks for multiple tests, and contact
you by email.

_______
Another point of concern was the requirement that projects used the
system call wait() to wait for the termination of child processes.
This had nothing to do with whether your project used pipes or
temporary text files, as the wait() call was simply required to
wait for the termination of the sort program.  The markers were not
looking to see if you used wait() to determine if all output back
from sort must have been sent.  The use of wait() has nothing to
do with enforcing any particular scheduling pattern, nor directing
what happens if a pipe fills with data before it is read.  Yes,
processes which lose their parents are inherited by the init process,
but it's strongly preferred practice to wait for a child process,
rather than to just 'forget' about it.  It's akin to using fclose()
to close a file, if our code used fopen() to open it.

_______
I do not wish to be adversarial on the above points, and wish to remind
you that you're still welcome to formally appeal this point through

Just checking for some clarification on the comment below. should CDPATH be treated the 
exact same as PATH, where we search for a match within the directories. I'm just clarifying 
because we are looking for a directory so it's possible that it was meant that we just 
check to see if the directory name is listed in the ":" separated string. 

So my question is: are we searching within the directories in the string for the directory, 
or do we just check the string and if no match we don't go any further? 

"As with the role of PATH for command execution, the variable CDPATH points to a character 
string which is interpreted as a colon separated list of directory names. If the user 
enters a directory-name which does not contain a '/' character, then the members of CDPATH 
are considered as directories to locate the required directory. "

Step 2 refers to the *command name*, as in

   commandname arg1 arg2

so in the command sequence:

   commandname1 arg1 arg2 ; commandname2 arg1 arg2 ; commandname3 arg1 arg2

you'll need to apply the actions of Step 2 three times.

Unsure what you mean by "(max of 2)"

In step 1, the program takes the user input and if it is a valid unix program like '/bin/ls' and 
'/usr/bin/sort' should use fork and execv to run those programs and return the results.

Eugene's answer is a good one.

(you may have some confusion,here)  but the shell does not *implement* the several thousand 
commands that we (could) use daily - it simply finds them and (attempts) to execute them.

This is a good approach because, if we write or download+install a new command, then the shells 
do not need to be informed or recompiled - they just need to find and execute the new command.

Yes, again logically.
It's only when our programs request access to a logical address, that the hardware memory 
management unit determines on which physical page or segment the required data or instruction 
really is.

From: poster082@student.uwa.edu.au
X-smilie: none

Hi there,

I noticed that there was some inconsistencies with the new parser behaviour for 
syntactically incorrect terminal commands. Specifically sequential commands

The following examples work as indended

myshell.3 ls &&
command expected after '&&'

myshell.3 ls ||
command expected after '||'

This results in no SHELLCMD instance being created, and therefore no command is run.

However the command

myshell.4 ls ;

will produce a SHELLCMD instance with the right node as null.
this can also be visualised on the myshell-display

I wanted to clarify if we're expected to check for this case in our code?

Thanks.

If a command line such as cd < in_file is given, where in_file contains some further
commands such as pwd && ls, should the commands from in_file be read and executed by
the shell until exiting upon reaching the end of in_file?

Apologies if the answer is obvious but I'm trying to understand the distinction
between the above case and executing a shell script. Is it just the access
permission of the file? ie a file input redirect is read only and a script is
executable.

Cheers.

That's a valid command sequence, so you should be able to execute it.
I don't believe that that case is inconsistent, because your earlier examples are errors.
Unfortunately, the web program does not report or draw the cases in error.

No, the cd command does not read its destination directory from its standard input.

That's OK, but it's "obvious" because it's something you can and should just check in your real 
everyday shell.

This cd example has nothing to do with shellscripts.

  So the contents of the file should not be read and executed? Or does the shell only read the 
  contents of the file as it streams in?
  
  This is from the specification page:
  "The sequence   command < infile   requests that the command use infile as its standard input."   

  How does a command have a file as it's standard input?

> That's OK, but it's "obvious" because it's something you can and should just check in your real

  Did check but the only meaningful results I got were when the command takes a file argument to
  begin with, such as sort < in_file. What about arbitrary commands?

My interpretation is that the file provides the arguments for cd. 

Eg: cd /usr/bin 
/usr/bin would be the arg found in infile.

The sentence you've quoted is correct.  The contents of 'infile' provides the standard input to any general 
command, including cd, replacing the keyboard for just that command.
However, the cd command does not require or read any additional input to do its work, and will not actually 
read anything from its standard input.

>   How does a command have a file as it's standard input?

The file redirection provides the names of files from which a command's input may be read (or written to).
Using both input and output redirection, we can copy one file to another with:

   cat < oldfile > newfile

Commands use a variety of mechanisms, and combinations of them, to work in different ways - including 
requiring no, a fixed, or a variable number of command-line arguments, input file redirection, and output 
redirection.

I think it is fine to have it as a 84msec on the terminal. However, your approach to the 'time' 
command looks incorrect. You need to call 'time' with a command directly afterwards, not on the 
next command called on the command line. Look at how the normal 'time' command works on Unix.

I think you might be confusing command line arguments with standard input. The command cd takes a directory name as an 
argument.

So you would call it like this:

cd [directory_name]

Now consider the program wc (word count). It can take a file name as a command line argument, like so:

wc [my_file]

But if you do not provide a file on the command line, it will read from standard input, which is by default the keyboard 
(displayed through the terminal). So if you just call "wc", the terminal will prompt you to write some stuff, and you can 
stop by calling Cntrl-d. wc will count how many words/lines/characters you wrote. Try it.

When the specs say "The sequence   command < infile   requests that the command use infile as its standard input." It 
means that instead of waiting for you to write some stuff on the keyboard, the program will go ahead and process whatever 
is in the file.

So if you call "wc < infile", wc will count the words/lines/characters in infile. Note that this is exactly the same as 
calling "wc infile". This is because wc is a 'filter' - it takes a file as an argument or reads from standard input, and 
'<' means to use the file as standard input.

TL;DR: command line arguments are not the same as standard input. Arguments tell the program how to behave, whereas 
standard input is what the program actually processes.

My understanding is that programs will always read their input from file descriptor 0 and

the keyboard. 

So in step 6 we have to find a way to make file descriptor 0 point to "infile" instead of

When you express stdin as a file descriptor, correct me if I'm wrong, but should decay to the 
int 0 by default. So yes, I think stdin would be an alias for 0. Each process will have an in, 
out and error stream, so you just have to redirect that stream to a different file descriptor 
i.e. number.

I'm a bit confused as to how you would logically test the shellscript functionality 
of myshell. I've got several shellscripts that I want to test to see if they work. 
But the PATH directories all appear to be hidden directories not linked to the one 
pointed to by cd in the working directory. Because the Search Path only goes through 
the lists in PATH, will I need to navigate manually and find the individual 
directories to test the function?

Also on a side question, for people running BASH on Windows, is there a reason why 
CDPATH is never listed in the environment variables?

A program will read its input from stdin and send its output to stdout.

stdin, stderr and stdout are all created by the C runtime at program startup, and each have an 
associated file descriptor.

You shouldn't rely on stdin or stdout mapping to specific file descriptor numbers, as this is an 
implementation detail. Instead, use STDIN_FILENO, STDOUT_FILENO, etc.

The trick to step 6 is to make the standard input/output file descriptors map to the infile/outfile 
somehow. For this you should investigate the dup2 function.

Good luck with the project.

Great answer, thanks.

(Pedantically, there is a slight difference between  wc filename   and  wc < filename
In the 1st case, wc will report the filename; in the 2nd case it doesn't because it doesn't know it :-)

You should be able to run them by specifying their full pathname:

/full/path/to/shellscript

or first change to its directory, and then run it:

cd /full/path/to

Don't know;  bash won't list an environment variable if it's not set to a value (!), so 
perhaps it's not set, by default, on Windows.
Can you set it, and then see if it's now listed?

Looking at the given example

    (sort ; ps) < junk1 >> junk2

Is it expected that 'junk1' be sorted before it goes to 'junk2' and also possibly have 
'ps' output appended also?

Or is this a straight 'junk1' is input and 'junk2' is output because they are both on 
the same CMD_SUBSHELL level?

If it's the former can we just expect one infile for any single command line input as 
opposed to say 

    (sort; (sort) < junk1) < junk2 > junk3

which would require keeping a memory of two instances of infile at two different sub-
shell levels?

Just wondering how we are expected to report termination of background processes?
Currently I have a simple implementation printing to stderr "process blah has terminated"
but noticed bash initially gives a process number and prints it and the pid,
eg:

[1] 50

and when the process terminates it prints out, for example:

Done [1]+              cal

is this the extent to which we're expected to implement the background process reporting?

let me know if the question I've asked is confusing and needs clarification,

Thanks :)

I seem to encounter a possible problem where inputting something random (not a valid 
command) such as "banana" will simply go to the next line of input even though I have tried 
placing waitpid() and wait() with checks of WIFEXITED and WEXITSTATUS in the parent section 
of the fork. I then have to use "exit" (n+1) times if I inputted (n) nonsense commands.

Is there a reason I'm not able to receive a check of WIFEXITED or WEXITSTATUS directly 
after that line of input? (Here is a very small amount of code)

int value = 0;
pid_t exited = waitpid(program_id, &value, 0);

Any help is appreciated.

Wont this just become the same problem as before? It seems that the PATH environment variable 
only lists hidden directories. Like /usr/bin/ls:/usr/bin etc. It doesn't seem to include on 
disk directories such as Documents etc. So how will I specify the path? This is for Step 8, so 
it will be running through the PATH environment.

For this part, isn't that just running through the regular terminal? Same question as above 
relates, cd doesn't take its directories from PATH. What do you suggest then?

I'm still working on trying to get CDPATH to initialise. Is it that CDPATH is the on disk 
directories that the user accesses directly?

Just wanted to clarify that we only use the CDPATH variable if the entered command 
doesn't contain a '/' character?

For instance, if I cd into a folder I know is in my current directory (by typing: cd 
someFolder), unlike the actual cd command which would just go into that directory, in 
this case we would search through the CDPATH variable as the question states?

Or do we also have to provide the functionality of being able to cd into the folder 
within the current directory using just its name without its '/' path.

Thank you.

You can specify the full path to any file in any directory. Eg for me using bash on ubuntu on 
windows to access my windows Documents folder /mnt/c/User/whateveryouruseris/Documents, so to 
execute a file from there I'd execute 
/mnt/c/User/whateveryourusernameis/Documents/executablethingy. Or if it's in the directory . then 
you just would execute ./executablethingy or executablethingy

Something simple such as "background process 12345 has terminated"
will be fine.   No specific format nor wording required.

(well considered)

There is now a Clarification (26th October) stating that we should only use the CDPATH 
variable if the provided directory name does not *commence* with a '/' character.

This brings myshell into agreement with how bash performs.

Thanks.

Should background processes be able to read from stdin/stdout or should these be 
closed to them? Leaving them open seems to lead to odd behavious but closing them 
causes programs such as sort (without args thus using stdin) to complain of a bad 
file descriptor, whereas bash records the processes and stopped and requires fg to 
bring them back?

The parser deciphers what the user inputs, but for step 4 does it have all the data we need 
to execute it in the right order? For example, does it tell us how sub-commands need to be 
executed, and what order or do we need to write code for counting commands and finding 
their order ourselves?

Does the shell exit or just hang about waiting for instruction without the next input line?

Good starting things to check might be how you're using wait, fork, exit, or closing the pipe and so on

I'm sitting on the same problem.

When it doesn't go to the next line mine is just waiting for another command to go in.  It 
won't display the next myshell.num though I can still input commands that work with varying 
degrees of success.

Depending on where and if I close the input/output sides of the pipe it can cause a hard exit.

I've tried using _exit from the forked child which allowed the next line to come in straight 
away but but then it wouldn't accept any other commands.

My understanding was that wait wouldn't be required when using pipe as the this could cause 
issues if there was more data than can be written into the buffer.

Exit with Ctrl-Z shows the process have become zombies pretty much no matter what I do.

So the shell just hangs there. I didn't use wait in the parents because from my understanding, the process should 
go concurrently?

That would just indicate that cal interprets standard input in that way, not that it uses 
them as command line arguments.
Think of sort as an example. Sort < infile does the same as sort infile, because as sort 
infile (infile as a command line arg) sorts the contense of a file, but sort with no args 
sorts standard input, so if you have a file that says "hi bob my name is jeff" and go sort < 
infile it'll sort that, (for comparison also try sort with no args on bash, type the same 
text, and press ctrd D to end stdin), not use "hi bob my name is jeff" as command line 
arguments which tell the command how to run.
For cal, I don't know for sure, but I think if you tried using your infile as -y 2014 or 
some other cal flags you could normally use as arguments maybe it would get confused (?), 
but I really don't know for sure.
Hope that kind of made sense?

Ok so there is a way to use wait with the pipe, you just want to do  it at the right time, because you want to allow 
your child processes to complete before exiting or carrying on with your parent process. If you're getting hangups 
and havent used wait the issue is something else though.

Be careful also with where you're closing pipe ends. Also the guy mentioning abrupt exits, you might want to consider 
the logic of what you're doing to file descriptors and how you might need to change it (hint: look at myshell.c and 
one of its while loops!).

Honestly, I would suspect you both might have issues mainly with how/where you're forking and closing file 
descriptors and stuff. I really don't want to risk giving anything too much away about the nitty gritty so won't say 
more than consider that you want to be able to do the following: link up stdin/stdout to a pipe, do stuff relating to 
stdio, and close the pipe... (think about the consequences of each part!)

So to clarify the approach to this question, 
the cmd<infile would not read the content of 
the file (treating it as an argument)? So 
instead, it will use the name of the file and 
execv the name of the program and the name of 
the infile? And then the system would do the 
rest for us? Is that right? 

Thanks

No. You use the infile contents as standard input, that isn't at all what I said.
Read the useful c99/posix functions on the project description for that part, then 
figure out how to use them.

Execv can't do anything but a program and arguments, so saying you would 
execv the program and infile is the same as using infile as a command line argument,
since execv just takes a program and arguments, which as previously stated 
is not at all the same as standard input.

I must say this has us stumped too.

What kinds of commands take an infile?

I had thought that the infile contained arguments to be used by the command. 
Ie running - 
cal < infile

and the infile contains - 
-y 2017

Then the shell would run - 
cal -y 2017

This however doesn't seem to be how it works.  I can see that sort < infile sorts the file, but what 
other commands require this kind of operation?

Thanks

This is kind of a follow up question to the thread I jumped in on earlier.

I'm trying to finish off the pipeline section but I can't seem to push the EOF to the 
reading process so it never exits.

In the example below grep.

   sort text1 | grep a

grep seems to hang no matter how I try to close the read and write pipes.  Read and 
write instances in parent and child processes are definitely being called to close but 
not sure why EOF is not being sent (or maybe received).

This question has been asked before by me but I can't find the old thread to repost, so 
I've made a new one.

Not sure if other people are having this problem, but I can't seem to get CDPATH to show up 
in the environment variables, both on bash on ubuntu on Windows, as well as the CSSE Macs. 
I know the myshell.c automatically initialises CDPATH to ../.. if detects the environment 
variable as NULL. But because of this, I don't know how I would go about checking the 
functionality with CDPATH for both the cd and shellscript commands. 

I've tried initialising the paths myself, but if I'm assuming that CDPATH points to a whole 
list of directories of the whole disk's file system, this would be too many to type out.

Any ideas how I can solve this?

Just completely separate infile and command line arguments in your head. Completely. They're not the 
same.

Infile is used as standard input. That is it. Some commands and programs work with standard in, and how 
they work with standard in is defined in the command or program.

Arguments are different, they tell the program what to do with their input.

The specifics of which commands require it is irrelevant, what matters is that you can make a command 
that has an option for standard in to work in some way run using standard in from a file... instead of 
from your keyboard and mouse.

By EOF I assume you just mean you want to stop the process reading from the pipe reading 
from the pipe? I think your pipe is probably still open to reading somewhere, or you've 
got some of the rest of your logic in the wrong places.

Well, cat and sort both can use stdin but they also can both just take a filename as an argument. If you don't try 
implementing it where infile's name is used as an argument, you should be able to test with those. I don"t know any 
example that works with stdin but also can read a file specified in arguments, sorry.

I would also suggest you read up on the concept of Standard Input Streams, because the way you are referring to it as an 
"infile" makes me think you misunderstand the concept. The '<' directive means the following file is read as standard input; it 
does not mean the program is 'opening' a file.

There is no set rule on how you split it up - a good rule of thumb is to split up independent 
pieces of program logic. One file per step is a good start, but if you feel like you can have a 
couple of questions in the same file and the code is still "clean", then that should not be an 
issue. We just don't want to see monolithic files. :)

I don't reckon it needs to be for each step as that may not always make sense but it is partly 
personal preference.  

The idea is probably that if you had to hand over this source to someone else would the files 
have functions logically grouped so you aren't having to keep five open and swapping between 
them to read through the execution of a simple task.

I've got a process.c file which handles a lot of the routing of stuff but then have 
internal.c, external.c, redirect.c and the like to help implement them.  But external.c is 
probably too small so I might combine it into process.c.

I think as you move through the project you will probably notice where things can be split 
out.

If you mean some of the external functions defined in parser.c, then yes. However, I 
would not expect them to be all through you code.

Just to let you know, there is nothing inherently wrong with a file that has a "small" amount of code - 
whatever the boundary conditions may be for a "small" classification. If separating the program into 
smaller segments helps readability, that is a good thing. 

You will not be penalised for having a file with a single function that does exactly what the question 
asks you for, and uses correct C programming practises and is well commented. 

I am not telling you what you are doing is wrong - just letting others know that if they prefer to keep 
things separate, they are more than welcome to do so. :)

How would you run a shellscript in myshell? I know u need to put "bash file" in the normal

When dealing with cd I can easily implement commands such as

cd CITS2002
cd 'ASSIGNMENT 2'

However whenever I try to combine them (see below) it gets a bit confusing since 
the parser doesn't seem to recognise single quotes and therefore splits the 
command up like so.

cd CITS2002/'ASSIGNMENT 2'

| "cd" | "CITS2002/'ASSIGNMENT" | "2'" | NULL |

Is this something we should worry about or am I misunderstanding something (most 
likely)?

I think you are misunderstanding the nature of stdin/stdout. You should not need to read in the 
file into an array to redirect the output.

Ah okay, however, I don't quite get how we use can use execv() to include both t->argv for the original 
command and the new standard input after t has been created. For example, sort test.txt works due to step 2, 
but I don't quite know how to make sort < test.txt work in step 6.

execv doesn't include the "new standard input", it automatically will use standard input, all you have to do is
make standard input what you want it to be. read manual pages for dup2 and open(2) properly, and revisit the slides
from the lecture where file descriptors were talked about. just as a note, when you put in cmd1 < infile, the argv

I was just wondering if the Chilli question is non-compulsory the same as in labs.  

So is it a bonus mark question or is it part of the basic marking structure.

Basically if in the step 1-2 you come across a file that exists but execv fails treat it as a 
shellscript, and run a myshell with that as its standard input.

The project description should give you enough information to know that :) plus the lecture descriptions on how file opening with append works

So once it fails after trying with all path names, it checks if the file exists, and if it does, it will 
use the file as a stdin? (hence, it is similar to redirecting stdin to a file like question 6?)

Is that right??

I think test program is up so maybe you could test this on the lab computers? Although I

After it finds the file (possibly in one of the paths) if executing the file fails, then it uses the contents of the file as standard input for when you then execute myshell.
I actually can't think of a clearer way to say it than what the project description does. (I tried then but it turned out almost identical)

Step 8? With the shellscripts? I have a feeling I know what your "easy way" is, and just a thought for you: what happens if you type exit to exit myshell after you do that.

There could be more than one way to skin a cat, or there could be a reason.

file.txt has the content of:

cal ; ls
date

I understand that after execv fails to execute the file, we must assume its a shell script. I am not quiet sure how to approach the executing part of this step.

I am just not sure about the last line saying "in this case you should execute another copy of myshell to read its input from the shell script".
When it says execute another copy of myshell, does it mean we fork it again? 
My approach is to use fork, then change the t->infile to the given filename and then try calling execute_shellcmd(t), with the newly modified t->infile.
but i ended up with an infinite loop.

I have tried other method to,by reading the file line by line, and try to execute it, but it doesnt recognise the ; or && or any of the type.

The description says it should execute myshell, and I feel anything more than that I say is essentially telling you explicitly what to code.

As for changing t-> infile... what you've said is if you have "shellscript", and you say to myshell "shellscript" and it goes to execute, and fails, you want it to say "shellscript" has infile "shellscript".

You need to apply thought from previous parts of the process, everything links and grows your understanding and ability to do the next bit.

If thinking about it doesn't help I recommend walking away, having a glass of water, and returning to think.

PATH is a string... with things you need separated by colons. You need to go through and use each of those plus the command name to execute them.

Chris may upload the solutions at some stage, but I doubt it will before semester 
finishes. At any rate, it is much better to go through the questions without solutions 
first. 

 From experience talking to people practising for the mid-semester test, a lot of people 
did not attempt to answer some of the code-related questions by simply trying them out 
on the computer - we have the luxury in computer science of being able to do that, and 
learn a lot as a result. This may help direct your exam study if you are currently 
without direction. 

With respect to scaling, that is dependent on a range of factors - the biggest factor, 
of course, being your (and your peer's) performance. I am going to be *that guy* and 
suggest working towards getting as good a mark as possible, without factoring in 
scaling. Especially when there is no guarantee that, if marks *are* scaled, they will be 
scaled UP...

A quick check on Onesearch (which you are able to do yourself) provides a few other practise 
papers. These units are always evolving, however, and as a result the content of a past exam

The project outline provides you with a clue; the "strchr" function is useful in this regard. 
Think about how you can use "strchr" on the PATH variable, and then how you can use a control-
flow loop to use this in conjunction with the command you are passing to 'myshell'.

You should not need to read in lines from the file in your code. I think you have misunderstood what 
stdin is and what its role is in this part of the project.

Okey dokey, so I re-read it a few times:

"... a shell script (a text file) containing more myshell commands. In this case you should execute another copy 
of myshell to read its input from the shell script..."

So the main() provided in myshell has:

while(!feof(stdin)) {
	SHELLCMD *t = parse_shellcmd(stdin);

	if(t != NULL) {
	    exitstatus = execute_shellcmd(t); 
	    free_shellcmd(t);
	}
}

However, when I use dup2(executable_file, STDIN_FILENO) followed by close(executable_file) and then execving 
myshell with the executable_file as input, I am still unable to read more than one line - although that one line 
obeys steps 1-7 as hoped. Does this mean that the text file will have only one line? I'm sorry if I'm not 
catching on very easily, thanks for the help.

fails to process the last line without it because I used a short cut (not 
fopen/fclose) and can't handle the EOF manually.  

I'm essentially hoping to hide behind standards so I don't have to change it =)

As you've stated, many standard programs anticipate having their standard input open, even 
if they don't require any input or can work with 'no' input.

The general practice is to open the special file  /dev/null
to a background process's standard input - there's a connected file there, and as soon as 
you read from it you get the end-of-file condition.

*All* commands that you shell can execute, except for the 3 required *internal* commands 
specified in the project sheet are termed *external commands*,
and they can occur anywhere in command sequences.

CDPATH is usually an environment variable used internally by the shell;
I do not know if it's exported from your shell, on all platforms, to then be available to other 
programs.  If not (on Windows?) type:

     export CDPATH="dir1:dir2:dir3"

in your standard shell.

They can appear anywhere in the file-system, and so you use a name that helps your shell to find and execute them.
They are located just as are external commands - using the PATH variable if the provided name does not contain a '/'

Those functions are listed a big hints; ones that the sample solution uses.
You don't have to use them, and can use other functions.

And, if it's not obvious, don't execute commands with   sh -c "command..."

You may be confusing the internal and external ways of indicating errors.
If the call to the chdir() function fails, with -1 as you say, and you need this reflected output 
side of myshell (when it exits) then, yes, report it as EXIT_FAILURE.

errno is a variable only seen/known within a running program; it's final value is not 
reflected/known by external programs.

In the past they have both been scaled (up) and not scaled.
The marks for the test and 1st project, this year, have both been slightly higher than 
last year.  Don't forget, you're only seeing aggregate marks for the whole unit, which 
doesn't distinguish marks from this students 'not included' in the Faculty stats which 
trigger scaling (or not).

Focus on doing really well in the 2nd project and exam and we may scale downwards!

Ryan's comment is correct - your shell does not read in the shellscript's lines for another shell.

Moreover, if execv() succeeds it will not return, so you loop could only ever execute at most once.

Yes, of course, and its corresponding free() function.
I'm not sure how you'd approach Step-8  (other than badly) without using that function.

While not a very useful example, it should (at this stage) be trivial to invent command sequences that test things, e.g.

No doubt, but the questions are:

- on which platform, and
- are you finding that myshell's C variable named CDPATH *is* set for you?

You could just test it with the .. and . That the default defined in myshell.h has? As a worst

I'm on an Apple computer and CDPATH is set to DEFAULT_CDPATH because getenv("CDPATH")

Great, thanks, all working as intended.
If you wish to use/test with another value of CDPATH,
set it in your primary shell, export it to any child processes of your shell,
and restart your   myshell  which should 'pick up' the newly defined value.

Yes, always the right approach.
Keep in mind that your standard shell will also produce the correct result (and the sample solution is supposed 
to!).

With examples like   ls | (wc | wc)

you can see the progression of data, left to right, by running 'by hand' each of:

ls
ls | wc
ls | wc | wc
ls | (wc | wc)

and ensuring that it's giving the results expected.

Then, for more a test of your logic about subshells, than implementation, try:

  (cd /tmp ; ls) ; ls

Very helpful info! For some reason I was thinking that the subshell may affect the progression of the pipe, such as:

first step - (wc | wc)
second step - ls | (r of first step)
 
When actually (as you stated before) it goes from left to right, giving the same result for:

ls | wc | wc
ls | (wc | wc)
(ls | wc ) | wc

Same result but not processed the same way (due to the subshell process).

Are you sure you don't call exit(EXIT_SUCCESS) or exit(EXIT_FAILURE) outside of a child 
process when using fork()? Anyone feel free to correct me but from what I've been 
experimenting with, whenever you implement these system calls outside of a child process it 
exits the shell.

I'm slightly worried that I have the wrong approach to Step 8 as I didn't require fopen()

2. Try execv() on the file.

3. If it fails, fork and use previous methods - dup2() - to use execv() on myshell with the 
executable file as stdin.

It doesn't work perfectly yet - it only reads and executes the first line of the text file 
- but I was wondering if my interpretation of the problem was wrong and what I have missed.

Any help is appreciated. =)

Sorry everyone; I’ve not been able to get the teaching materials to Trent in time, though 
I will get them to our website in a few days.

Nothing from today’s cancelled lecture is in the final exam :-)

Good luck with finishing off your projects.

So far, file redirection is working as expected, but the prompt for the next 
command does not appear after the fact.

This is what I'm getting:

myshell.1 ls > output.txt

As in, myshell.2 does not appear. Additionally the output.txt file reads as 
follows:

---

desktop.ini
execute.c
execute.o
globals.c
globals.o
makefile
myshell
myshell.c
myshell.h
myshellnew
myshell.o
output.txt
parser.c
parser.o

myshell.2

---

It looks like the next prompt got recorded in the file somehow.

Any ideas what could be causing this issue? Thanks!

you've redirected all the output from your process to that file, and haven't told it to stop outputting to that file everything that is in stdout. (my suspicion anyway)

The file descriptor table is per-process, not local to a function or block of code. 
Ie, if we redirect standard IO a file, the process will continue to send output 
there until its termination or until standard IO is redirected somewhere else again. 

So somewhere you have redirected the standard output to output.txt. But for which 
process did you redirect standard output? Hint: myshell never actually redirects its 
output anywhere.

Not required; we're only building a small subset of a 'real' shell.
No need to imagine it any more difficult than it is :-)

As an aside,  (ls > output1.txt) > output2.txt

is a valid command sequence, with the output of ls appearing in the first file, and 
nothing appearing in the second (a zero-sized file should be created).

Why are you checking for that form?
The presence of a '/' anywhere in the command's name indicates if the value of PATH should be used, 
independent of whether it turns out to be an executable (a binary, .exe...) or a shellscript.

There's no special forms to look for.

It's a funny definition of "...as expected" !

Suggest that you look at where you are using the dup() or dup2() system calls; your 
output suggests that they're done in the wrong place/wrong time.

Bash completes the background process instantly and orphans the sleep command but keeps it running. 
Are we keep our project like this (ie. no waiting for child process to finish).

Hi all, when looking at step 5, it first shot out to me that the simplest way to 
perform the task would be to run execute_shellcmd(t->left) while in the child process 
if a subshell was detected, but after having another look at the question, is it 
required to run the myshell program with execv or something similiar to perform the 
task? Thank you for your time, and apologies if it's a silly question.

Uhh, just to clarify, do you mean 'no' as in my original method is not allowed, or 'no', it

When using the sample myshell on the lab macs, the command "man" returns a value of 0 
meaning success which is actually not supposed to happen (0=success, 1=fail), it 
should return 1. So if you were to type "man && ls" it would execute man and then ls 
because man returned 0. When typing "man && ls" in a unix terminal it does not execute 
ls after man.

Is this an error in the sample myshell???

Ah yes, I learnt that I shouldn't be reading in lines and calling execv but now I also know that the ./ is not 
necessary and I should call execv once only. Thanks =)

No :-)
Thanks for the detailed description (thought I didn't think I'd get this simple thing wrong :-)

While to both you and I running just   man
with no arguments looks like it should be an error (and hence man should exit with failure) it 
appears that 'man' on macOS exits with a 0, and on Linux exits with a 1.
Neither manual entry mentions what is expected in this situation.

So the myshell sample is correct because it's just reflecting what its host operating system 
and application programs tell it.

Not a silly question and, in trying to answer it, consider the execution of the sequence

  ( cd /tmp ; pwd ) ; pwd

Which of your 2 methods can, and which can't, achieve that result, and why?

Hi,

No; there'll be greater emphasis on the use higher-level/systems' things, particularly ones 
that can best be checked manually and not automatically.  And far less emphasis (marks) on 
absolutely expected good practices like comments and identifier names.

Sorry but I was hoping to get some direction with the background processes. I'm kinda 
lost as what to do.

So what I think i figured out is, in the tree that is parsed, if a node is the 
background node then (let's say the node only has a left branch) the last command to 
be executed before we exit the left branch is the command that we do not wait to 
finish before returning to the background node from the left branch.

I think this is right but I cant figure out how to implement it. Like, i think the 
question is, how do we let our program know that for the last command to execute 
before returning to the background node (i.e. exiting the left branch to the 
background node in our example) is the one to not wait for? How would the program know 
thats even the last command?

Some help would be appreciated and also if im on the right track.

Also, how much is step 9 worth for the final marks?

 have a look at the tree diagram thing  on the clarifications. I'm not 100% sure, but fairly sure it should just be the one to the left? or at least the parser will lay out the tree so that you just have to treat whatever's down that t->left from background is not waited for

You should just execute the commands in the forked process. Did you look at how the parser designs the tree for subshells?

You do not need to support the expansion of '~' for this project.

(if its support was required, you need to expand it for all command arguments, not just the cd 
command, and you'd need help from OS-specific functions to resolve usernames other than your 
own.)

read the instruction, then look at what HOME is, and look at how main sets up HOME.

Hello I got background processes somewhat running but Im just curious for some last clarification. When it says that "when myshell exits, it should terminate the still running background processes", does it mean myshell exiting by calling the exit exterrnal command we wrote so 
for example:

myshell.1: exit 0 (then it kills background processes)

or does it mean just when an myshell exits after running some commands for example:

myshell.1: sleep 5 & cal (so after cal finishes executing without waiting for seep it then kills the background process i.e. sleep)

thanks for any help

If you just run commands, myshell shouldnt exit. Sleep5&cal should do cal, and in the background sleep, and go to the next input line "myshell.2" or whatever number while sleep still runs, it shouldn't exit.
The idea is you could run some process that takes a long time, keep doing stuff, and it goes in the background, but if you exit with exit then it should terminate the background process(es) thats(/'re) still going if there are any

If anyone has a little advice it'd be grand - 

If we enter sleep 5 & ls into our myshell it runs ls and then sleeps for the 5 but doesn't 
give a my.shell prompt in between.

We have used kill and signal to stop and continue the first command but for some reason it 
seems that the parent is still waiting for the first child even though we've only coded it 
to wait for the second command.

Any tips?

Hi, 

I'm a bit confused about how to approach question 8. 

 From what I understand I need to read the file line by line, to get the commands. 
And to parse it use parse_shellcmd which accepts FILEs. But I have no clue how to do the 
part in between without using a temporary file. 

Any help would be awesome. 

Thanks!

 From my understanding, the parser can only take one line at a time, and for each time it is 
run, it will generate a command prompt, (almost) regardless of the input. So even if you pass 
in an empty line, the parser will run, and generate a command prompt.

I think you have to be able to function from another directory...It isn't too hard to find a bit of a way to manage it :) although I did have to look up a function, myself.

Hi Chris,

Does this mean commands inside shellscript will conaume input from the 
ahellscript? ie Will the following run cat and ita input will be the 
remainder of the file?

cat
abc

I also run into the same issue..So i assume there is no way around it huh? I was thinking of closing the 
stdout before calling the parse_shellcmd, but i dont think its ideal

Unsure how to diagnose what you're seeing, but it's not what you want (you know that!)

The only thing you should 'see' is the output of ls followed by the next prompt.
You should not 'see' any sleeping as that's happening in the background and (initially) you don't 
care about it, and so won't be waiting for it.

Should be no need to use kill to stop and restart any process.

Shellscripts are just text files containing sequences of other valid/understood commands - even calls to other shellscripts.

For this project we're not implementing any loops (would require changes to the parser, and it's not one of the listed Steps), but the 
script can contain the supported command sequences.

As we're discussing Step 8, I'll presume you've completed Steps 6 and 7?
You're certainly permitted to use the knowledge you gained from those steps, again, for Step 8.

Are you sure you need to *search* for the path to myshell?

You're already running myshell (when you wish to search), so you already 'have one'!

Of course there's a way around it!

The provided/unchanged parser only prints a new prompt when necessary, which is only when you're running myshell 
interactively - not required when running commands from a shellscript.

This is determined in the provided myshell.c, which you must have already read :-)

From: poster026@student.uwa.edu.au
X-smilie: none
X-img: none
X-anonymous: yes

When a background process is forked from the parent, but not waited on for
completion, the parent should be informed of the completion by catching a
termination signal with a user defined signal handler. Is this correct?

The problem is that once the handler is 'installed' it then catches the termination
signal of every child process, not just the one that was put in the background. So
you have to reap every child in the handler, rather than just have the kernel ignore
the signal by default. 

If what I've said above is correct then must myshell keep track of all the process
id's (and/or process group id's) that are spawned from a fork in order to check, in
the signal handler, that the one that was just reaped is a background job so that
myshell may 'report which background process has terminated'?

This just doesn't seem, to me, to be the correct way to do it. Any hint's, tips or
advice would be really really helpful as I've been stuck on this for ages... not to
mention the deadline is fast approaching!

TL;DR
Do we need to keep track of process id's (or at least background pid's)?

Cheers.

Your myshell will only be informed about the termination of processes that it has created, 
and they are either background processes or 'others' - so why track both types?

So does that mean there is a max number of background processes allowed? What is that number or
is that for us to decide?

This morning, when attempting to use putty to connect to the CSSE linux machines, and 
then to the imacs, after the very first step, putty gives a 'connection timed out', 
failing to prompt for password. Anyone else experiencing the same issue?

Hello,

What are the consultation times between today and the exam day? Are they any 
different from usual? Also, will Trent/Ryan be available during any lab times over 
the study break?

It is our understanding that we need to kill(stop) the process to the left of the & and then kill(continue) it

Our issue is that we haven't told the code to wait for the process on the left, yet it waits nonetheless.

Just having a small problem in step 7 (pipes) where I am correctly creating a pipe 
and changing stdin/out appropriately and then executing the commands correctly.

But then myshell prints the correct output, goes to the next user prompt line and 
immediately exits myshell back to bash.

I can confirm im only using exit() inside of child processes in all of my steps and 
have no idea what to look at to fix this small bug.

Thank you!

If it helps diagnose the issue, I have used a fork to execute the left subtree command 
within the child to assure the left hand of the pipe is completed before the right hand 
command is (which the parent waits for the child completion, and then executes the right 
shell command).

Same issue, my shell works fine until I have called a background process, then future 
processes that make use of fork won't print command prompt. 

If i hit enter, the command prompt returns. It must be to do with setting the signal for 
child process when dealing with background. It ends up setting for all processes. 

Is this same for you? Maybe need a way to reset the signal after background is done?

Yes. Don't think we need to reset the signal though.

Initially I thought that a write syscall (as in write the next prompt) was being interrupted 
because the kernel was passing the SIGCHLD signal off to the handler but the errno indicates
that this is not the case.

I'm completely stumped by this!

Unidrive is still functional, so if your files are on the netowrk you can use that to 
access them. If you have windows 10 with anniversary update installed, you can 
install the beta bash shell. You'll need to download the make and gcc packages 
through the shell, and (for mine at least) hasn't required too much change to the 
code.

I caused this problem by calling return in main(). I was able to get around this by managing the flow with 
return ints, but not returning them in main itself.

Nothing I can think of would be quicker than just going to the CSSE labs and using 
the machines there. There are some changes you can make so that cygwin can run the 
parser (something to do with getting fileno to work if I'm not mistaken) but I'm 
unsure of what exactly it is.

No, there should be no need to stop(suspend) processes and resume them.
I'm unsure how you can to this thought; once you call fork(), you have 2 running processes, each of which can run (for 
its own purposes) or wait.

Any chance it's as a simple as missing break statement in a switch/case branch, and the control flow is just 'dropping 
through'?

Mackenzie is correct; the servers are probably experiencing a high load. 

There have been plenty of opportunities to test code previously on the system up until now. 
There is also 24/7 access to the CS labs for anyone studying a CITS unit, and there have been 
ample opportunities to come in to lab sessions dedicated to CITS2002 units. These have, up 
until this week, been very empty. 

In a similar way to how there is no exceptions for late submissions due to system overload when 
everyone submits at the same time, it is unlikely an exception will be provided because the 
testing facilities are overloaded right before the assignment is due. As indicated above, there 
has been time to prepare for this.

Do not do this.
You do not need to 'get between' two processes connected by a pipe, the shell plays no role in 
pushing the output through or interfering with the scheduling.

The left-hand-side could send no data through the pipe, or an 'infinite' amount, and then may 
terminate immediately or continue its execution 'indefinitely'.
The shell is unaware of how these commands execute or communicate, and should not be involved 
other than waiting for the right-hand-side to finish.

Focus on, print out if necessary, the 1st parameter that you're passing to countEntries().

"You tell them to terminate, then wait for them to finish, your program gives them a shot to

Obviously I was mistaken about what was to happen with the first child process, I was under the impression it needed to be suspended 
until the second child completed.  Now that I've removed that part from the code the same problem stands.  

We fork to first process -> in the parent we then fork to second process -> we wait for second process
What actually happens though is, first process starts ->second process starts->second process finishes->shell waits for first 
process to finish

As far as I can tell there's no need for any break statements, the first child finishes and sends SIGCHLD to the parent as 
expected.....but for some reason the parent waits until this happens......I'm baffled

Are you waiting for the specific process that you require, or accidentally waiting for *all* processes with something like:

    while( wait(&status) > 0)
        ;
?

Too difficult to answer multiple anonymous people each describing their specific, though 
similar, problems.

We fork a process if we need a copy of it, and we need two concurrently executing 
processes if they are to communicate using a pipe  (you knew all this).
But the shell has no role other than creating and connecting these processes, and 
waiting for the 'most right-hand' process to terminate (by itself).

*facepalm*

Thanks.....totally missed that.  Fixes Problem A....

Now that has opened up a new kettle of fish though.

I am obviously misunderstanding the kill signal.

I have put a signal(SIGCHLD, handler) in the parent and a kill(parentpid, SIGCHLD) in the child.....however it seems to be catching all the 
pids of all the running processes....

Obviously I am wrong....any tips as to where my understanding is lacking?

My understanding is that by putting signal(SIGCHLD, handler) in the parent, you are saying to use the handler for every child over the existence of my 
shell. So when you run step 1 etc, the handler is called. Not sure if this is what you mean by catching all pids.

Hi, quick question,

Does our shell have to function even if commands are typed in wrong? 
For instance, if the user inputs "bin/ls" instead of "/bin/ls" or "/ls" instead of 
"ls" on its own?

Thanks :)

I think the aim of this project is to replicate the shell program found in most unix based 
computers - a simpler one, of course. If you have questions regarding how your shell should 
perform. Why not test it out?

Just did a quick test on bash on MacOS:
bin/ls - doesn't work
/bin/ls - works
/ls - doesn't work
ls - works

I think its very important to note that this doesn't mean it's ok for these calls to blow up your

May be, but not possible to tell from the description alone.
Of course your initial copy of myshell should remain connected to the keyboard which the piping is 
going on,  so it should receive an end-of-file condition yet.

You shouldn't need the kill in the child process - when the child exits, the operating system will send a SIGCHILD to the parent 'for you'.

Thanks, that's all sorted.

Only issue we have now is as above, The process finished message tends to just appear in the prompt when the background is finished instead of waiting for 
prompt input before reporting process completion....any hints? :/

If i print the string I'm writing into the terminal it just the ^@ seem to just be blank

Anyone know how i can stop this?

Can the shellscript contain commands on multiple lines?

I've tried running the following shellscript. However, myshell only sorts infile. It does not sort someotherfile, and neither does it exit.
> sort < infile
> sort < someotherfile
> exit

When I run the following on myshell. It sorts the first two files but does not exit.
> sort < infile ; sort < someotherfile ; exit

Also, I've tried running the above shellscripts on bash. Either scripts work (except it does not exit). Also, I had to chmod u+x and prefix './' 
before it would let me execute it on bash. Are our myshells required to treat shellscripts the same way? Thanks!

Hi Chris,

In bash, a pipe doesn't finish execution until both sides of the pipe have finished. 
Whereas in the sample solution, the pipe seems to finish as soon as the right-side is 
finished.

An easy way to illustrate this is to run "wc | ls" (nonsensical, I know). In bash, this 
will keep running until you send an EOF to "wc". In the sample solution, it exists 
immediately when ls finishes.

My implementation does what bash does. Will this lose marks for being inconsistent with the 
sample solutions?

Straight from the description of Step 9:
"Similarly, when myshell exits, it should first terminate all of its still-running background 
processes, and wait for them to finish."

I'd take this to mean that, when 'myshell' exits, it calls on the background processes that it has 
spawned (and have not reached the end of their natural lifespan) to terminate and then waits for 
them to do so.

Does that clarify the issue?

Our implementation of background processes is signalling correctly, but it seems to be 
calling the  while(!feof(stdin)) again and again whenever the background process 
returns, causing an infinite loop as our main_command gets called again with the same 
input.

Those ^@ symbols you're seeing are terminal-output representations of null-bytes, e.g.

   cat -v myshell | less

Not sure why you're using fwrite() to display a string, rather than printf() or fputs(), but it 
appears that you're getting your string length/count wrong.

You have to make a shellscript both readable and executable (for any shell), else it's not a shellscript but a file with some text in it.
And it (obviously) has to be found by the shell, either through an explicit pathname or by using PATH.

If two outputs are being intermingled, it sounds like the process reporting background processes finishing is not the same process (the original) printing the prompt 
for the next command.  Outputs from different commands are not synchronised.

I'm not sure if I completely follow.....

I have the signal(SIGCHLD, handler) prior to the fork(), it is my understanding that when the SIGCHLD is received by the parent it runs the handler.....however I need it to run the 
handler AFTER the next command line input not in the command line itself (which it seems to be doing).

Ok, I feel like I'm getting close now:

    dirp = opendir(dirName);

    		*nFiles++;
    		printf("%s\n", dp -> d_name);
    	}
    	if(dp -> d_type == DT_DIR){
    		*nDirs++;
    		char path[1024];
    		if(strcmp(dp->d_name, ".")==0 || strcmp(dp->d_name,"..")==0){
    			continue;
    		}
    		snprintf(path,sizeof(path),"%s/%s", dirName, dp -> d_name);
        	countEntries(path, nFiles, nDirs);
    	}
    }
    closedir(dirp);
}


int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
    int *ptr1 = malloc(sizeof(int));
    int *ptr2 = malloc(sizeof(int));
    countEntries(argv[1], ptr1, ptr2);
    printf("number of files = %i\n", *ptr1);
    printf("number of directories = %i\n",*ptr2);
	
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}

But when I run it, I get ridiculous numbers printed out, i.e:
number of files = 759583829
number of directories = 52

Firstly, why do I need the 
if(strcmp(dp->d_name, ".")==0 || strcmp(dp->d_name,"..")==0){continue;} 
part? I found this code snippet whilst reading online, but not quite sure why we'd 
get a "." (present directory) or ".." (parent directory) when going through our 
directory..?

Also, please help me fix up the function to make it output the required nFiles and 
nDirs. I've been working on this for a while and really need to get onto other 
aspects of exam study.

Whenever I see ridiculous (often large) numbers coming out of my code, I first suspect that 
a variable has not been initialised to a meaningful value, or that I've messed up an 
address (pointer value) and tried to then print it out.

What was the initial value of your nfiles?

Every directory contains a . and a .. entry (always the first two entries that can never be 
removed).  Why do you think they're there,  and what would (does) happen if you make a 
recursive call to either . or ..  ?

Here's what I've got now. I believe that I'm correctly extracting each sentence, but maybe going wrong
after that...It compiles, but when I test it, gives a segmentation fault.



char **makeSentences(char *chapter, int *nSentences){
	char *ptr = chapter;
	int numSentences = 0;
	char **sentences = malloc(sizeof(char*));
	while(*ptr != '\0'){

		//EXTRACT A SENTENCE:

		int sentenceLength = 0;
		char *line = malloc(sizeof(char));
		while(*ptr != '.'){
			*line = *ptr;
			sentenceLength++;
			line = (char*)realloc(line, sentenceLength*sizeof(char));
			line++;
			ptr++;
		}

		//ADD THE SENTENCE TO AN ARRAY OF SENTENCES

		*sentences = line;
		numSentences++;
		sentences = realloc(sentences, numSentences * sizeof(char*));
		sentences++;
		
	}

	//RETURN THE ARRAY OF SENTENCES

	*nSentences = numSentences;
	return sentences;
}

Thanks so much for your help Chris! It seems to be working now. When I run it, I'm using 
"./testFolder" as the dirName (i.e. the test folder which is a subfolder of the pwd). Would that 
be fine to get full marks, or would our function need to accept just the NAME of the folder, 
somehow build a path, and then search through the directory?

My understanding is that the . entry is so that you can tell which directory you are in, and the 
.. entry is an easy way of finding out what the parent directory is. If you recursively searched 
through the . or .. entries, then you would be stuck in an infinite loop.

Just wanna ask, 
the question states:

"the function should match the following prototype: char **makeSentences(char *chapter, int 
*nSentences);"

does this imply that int *nSentences is an input and we assumed it is given to us?

Your code should be able to execute correctly from anywhere, and do its work 'on' anywhere;
for example:

   /path/to/myprogram  /usr/include

should work without change.

Your solution has sufficient 'good points' for it to get full marks,
but to be sure you could provide some relevant header files.

Good luck,

It's not exactly clear what *you* mean by 'input parameter' - C doesn't specifically use that 
terminology because parameters that, themselves, are pointers could (but don't have to be) used as 
input, output, or both  (using the common meaning from other languages).

However, the question asks "The number of sentences is returned via the function’s second parameter 
(nSentences)."  If the number of sentences was already known by the calling function, then there's 
be no reason to return that value, and so *nSentences would only be an input parameter.

int *nSentences is passed as a parameter, and we use this pointer to "return" a value (ie the 
number of sentences). Note that we dont explicitly return it, we just set whatever it's pointing 
to to an int indicating the number of sentences.


So has anyone got any advice about whether my function is close to correct, and if so, where am I 
going wrong? Cheers.

Command line debugging is possible through gdb or lldb, which are command line debuggers. It 
is also possible to program in an editor - such as Vim, or Sublime/Atom etc. - and then 
debug in a GUI, such as CLion or DDD etc. This becomes more of a preference that will 
develop over time and through exposure to different tools. I'd give gdb/lldb (depending on 
whether you're compiling with gcc or clang) a go - it is a useful skill to have, especially 
when debugging embedded systems' code.

Unfortunately, close in the approach taken but some errors that will make it fail.

Consider that chapter will be a vector of sentences - chapter[0] will point to the first sentence, 
chapter[1] to the second....

You'll need to allocate/extend the space for chapter each time you find a new sentences, and then make the 
newly allocated element of chapter point to a copy of the recently found sentence.

Your approach seems too complicated - 2 mallocs and 2 reallocs; you may find it simpler with 1 realloc and 
1 strdup.

I'm having trouble understanding the specifics of this question. I understand that
physical address is based on the amount of system RAM. I'm assuming the following
assumptions should made:

- Memory paging is used
- Arbitrary amount of memory, 64KB being the maximum memory size that can be
addressed in a 16-bit system?
- Pages are of arbitrary size, 4KB I suppose?

Am I on the right track here or am I missing something, cheers.

I feel like this is what I'm doing, with this code:


*sentences = line;
numSentences++;
sentences = realloc(sentences, numSentences * sizeof(char*));
sentences++;


Thanks.

Sorry, you're correct - after the hyphen, substitute chapter[x] for sentence[x]
(typing on a phone, for the inexperienced, is not fun)

In the code, above, you are not copying the actual sentence's contents (you may be thinking that that first 
assignment does that?)

And you cannot increment the value of sentences, in the last line, if you're hoping to pass it to a future call of 
realloc().

First person to express such a concern about the PDFs in my 15+ years of providing them 
this way.

What's such a 'nightmare' about printing them?
The reason I'm presenting them this way is so that you have room at the end of most 
pages to add your own notes.

are 'exposed' through the header files.  However, you may have more luck looking *inside* the header files 
for interesting terms:

  grep inode `find /usr/include -name '*.h'`

(or be over-enthused:  https://www.amazon.com/Mac-OS-Internals-Approach-paperback/dp/0134426541  )

I've just got so many questions at the moment so, sorry for the essay below!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Explain how the operating system maximises processor utilisation through virtual 
memory" 

Virtual memory gives the illusion that there is more memory available through the 
technique of indirection. 

Most processes do not require all of their allocated physical memory before they 
execute; memory may be loaded on demand. Therefore we can fit more process on a 
given amount of physical memory. Therefore said processes can be executed at a 
greater rate since memory is allocated more efficiently.  

Additionally, would it be beneficial in mentioning how virtual memory prevents 
memory holes and fragmentation through non-contiguous mapping to physical memory? 
Have I left anything out?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Provide three characteristics of procedural programs that result in their 
execution benefiting from cache memory"

I'm kind of stumped here. I can't think of three specific characteristics I know in 
general programs/processes?? will use cache memory since it's a lot quicker then 
regular RAM. Any help...?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Importance of logical to physical address.

Am I correct in saying that a logical addresses is a reference used to access the 
physical address. Therefore since processes are generally swapped back into any 
feasible range of physical memory (which is unlikely to be the same before) the 
physical address will change. So, we need a logical address which can be translated 
by the hardware to a physical address so the process can access the memory it 
has...?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"A 16-bit computer in which the logical address has a 10 bit offset. What is the 
maximum number of pages that a process can be allocated in this computer"

What's the intuition behind this? I can understand and draw a diagram of the 
logical to physical address translation but I have no idea where to go from here. I 
think I read online you divide the number of bits by the page size...?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks so much!

It is probably easier to add blank space than remove it, in that case. I didn't have any 
success trying to resize the white space out, nor a fast method to print the webpages 
directly.

I can't speak for (apparently) everyone else. but I'd rather not spend money printing out 
blank space. 

My intention is to print multiple pages on the same page and the "note space" eats a lot of 
that, making the text illegible. 

Fair enough?

Certainly not #import,  as it's not a C pre-processor directive.  #include

The question you wish to ask is, however, not "do we have to...?" but "should we...?"

As discussed in the lecture/workshop discussing the final exam, YES, provide relevant #include 
statements to demonstrate your understanding.  Markers will assume very little about what you may 
know - provide evidence.

Nope, still prints the "note space". I'd have to zoom in to 200% to get it to fill "normally". No printer 
setting can do that + multipage.

My understanding is that "improving processor utilization in a multi-programming system" 
means to "minimise the idle time due to I/O blocking" (taken from lecture slides 10 of 
Lecture 16). 
- I/O blocking means a process can't continue once it has requested input or output (unsure 
if this is correct)
- Virtual memory allows for extra memory space
- Processes can be in running state only when they have space available
- Therefore I/O blocking is minimised as more processes can run simultaneously
I am unsure if this is enough information. Also, please correct any misunderstandings. :)

It's not a matter of being fair, or not, it's a matter of what's practical.
The notes are written in their vertical format, to convey sufficient points about a single idea on a 
'page', and some pages are longer than others.  They're not written to all appear in a fixed aspect 
ratio, as are PPT slides, and can't be simply reformatted for landscape mode.  Sorry.

For what it is worth, I have right-clicked an example slide online, and clicked 'Save as PDF' (I am using the Opera 
browser). I can then orient it as a horizontal document, and print it. This may be an option for you.

I think the most challenging aspect is the fact that we have to use triple pointers 
(at least I think we do), and in class, we've only really used single pointers (apart 
from a few occasions maybe). I think that it wouldn't be too difficult to do if you 
had around 30 minutes and a computer to test your methodology (and search online for 
helpful functions), but doing it in around 20mins with no computer is very very 
daunting for me (and others, I'm assuming). The fact that we have to use triple 
pointers (which is a brand new concept for majority of the class) makes it even 
worse.

I think perhaps you are overcomplicating the question. Given it is asking you to create a data 
structure, think about how you could use other aspects of the C programming language you have 
learnt this year (e.g. structs) to work this out. 

I would also argue that a triple pointer is no more scary a concept than a double pointer. In 
fact, 'triple pointers' are not really a concept of their own; rather, it is just an instance 
of the pointer concept, in which a variable is pointing to a space in memory that itself is 
pointing to a space in memory. In these instances, a diagram can be very helpful - something I 
still do to this day if I'm having difficulty navigating a code base.

OK, as Ryan has suggested, let's try to simplify the apparent complexity of the problem.

Our spreadsheet is a 2D array of strings so, yes, using a triple pointer in summary.
What if, instead of each cell being s string (a pointer to a character), each cell was just an 
integer - we'd then have just a 2D array of integers, which seems simpler.

And if it were cells of integers, then we'd likely use simple arithmetic and assignment 
operators to set the cell's values,  as in

   cell[r][c] = newvalue;
   printf("%i ", cell[r][c] );
   ....
   cell[r][c] = 0;

Remembering that they're cells of strings, we can treat these assignment operators using simple 
operations/functions rather than ever having to deal with that 3rd level of pointer:

   cell[r][c] = strdup(newvalue);
   printf("%s ", cell[r][c] );
   ....
   free( cell[r][c] );
   cell[r][c] = NULL;

_____
Does that start to look any simpler?

Remember what defines a *whole* spreadsheet - not just its pointer to all the cells, but the number of 
rows and columns that define the shape of those cells, because we can't determine the number of rows and 
columns 'back' from the pointer.

And let's keep all of that defining information together, and develop functions to receive a single 
spreadsheet as a parameter, and to return a spreadsheet as a result.

typedefs and structures...

Apart from the strcpy's it looks correct. Try swapping the pointers 
instead, as you are presently copying to a NULL pointer which will cause 
an error.

Am I correct in saying that a process won't be "reset" when the timeout occurs (like I've assumed 
above) and it's moved from running to ready? So therefore it'll just take longer to execute as it?

The process certainly doesn't start from 0 (from main) again.
The Running process's state needs be saved, so that when it again advances to the head of the Ready queue, it 
may be resumed exactly from where it was suspended (with 3msec, 1msec, .... to go)
Another thread is discussing what this state may actually be/require.

Virtual memory enables multi-programming as it enables multiple processes to "exist" 
on RAM. Additionally, a process's memory can be loaded on demand and does not need to 
exist entirely on physical memory.

Virtual memory enables processes to demand more memory then actually allocated to it 
through the use of pages which are loaded on demand when required (occurs through the 
so called "page-fault").

Furthermore virtual memory stores the processes memory in non-contiguous blocks in 
RAM. These blocks are accessed through translation of the logical to physical address. 
Only the O.S knows the true physical address of different processes' memory. This 
protects processes from accessing each others memory. 

I know it's such a vague question but is the correct line of thought? 

I'm trying piece all the topics together so I get one clear line of thought when 
talking about O.S's and hardware.

Yep as Chris said, try to think of a matrix of pointers just as you would a matrix of integers. 

So instead of using strcpy, just write, in the for loop:

temp = spreadsheet[i][col1];

spreadsheet[i][col1] = spreadsheet[i][col2];

spreadsheet[i][col2] = temp;

What you are doing is:

strcpy(temp, spreadsheet[i][col1]); //the contiguous bytes of memory that temp points to will 
now hold the values of the string at (i, col1). But temp is a null pointer so you will get a seg 
fault.

strcpy(spreadsheet[i][col1], spreadsheet[i][col2]); // same as above. If the string is less than 
the second you get undefined behaviour.

Thank you for the reply.

But what I meant was will the project 2 marks be released before the release of the final unit results 
on dec 18, not at the same time or included in the final mark, but separately and before those unit 
results, just like getting the results of a normal assignment?

I ask this because some units will not return the final marks for assignments if the marks for those 
assignments were not already returned before the final exam.

As I said, 'Of course'.
(Don't hound us) but we'd hope to have project2 marked and returned by the end of next week.

So, in the exam, we would use a struct to do it, or would it be okay to do something like char *** 
structure, or would both methods be valid?

A few things:

First of all, like Chris said, don't increment sentences. Sentences points to the first element in the 
array and each time you increment it you lose reference to that first element. 

2. Do the reallocation at the start of the while loop, like so:

sentences = realloc(sentences, (numSentences + 1) * sizeof(char*));

The (numSentences + 1) is key because you make sure that when you add another sentence, you've 
allocated space for that sentence. You were getting a segmentation fault because the first thing you 
did was this:

*sentences = line;

If you think about it, when you get to that line on the second iteration, the last reallocation you 
did was for one pointer, not two. So your logic was flawed and hence the strange behaviour.

3. The point of manual allocation is so the memory exists after the block of code. Here you are 
realloc'ing space for each letter, when you can just use an array, and then duplicate that array. I've 
posted full code for this at the bottom so check that out. Basically I've just gone 
'thisline[ BUFSIZ ]' and then copied the contents into thisline.

> 			*line = *ptr;
> 			sentenceLength++;
> 			line = (char*)realloc(line, sentenceLength*sizeof(char));
> 			line++;
> 			ptr++;
> 		}

4. You don't increment past the full stop after you break out of this loop. This means that you will 
not enter the loop on the next iteration and will go on like this ad infinitum. 
So add a ptr++;

Also, make sure to append the null-byte to each sentence.

Here's what the code looks like now. It compiles and runs smoothly.

char **makeSentences(char *chapter, int *nSentences)
{
//	CREATE A POINTER TO TRAVERSE THE CHAPTER STRING
	char *ptr = chapter;
	int numSentences = 0;
	
//	INITIALISE THE ARRAY OF SENTENCES
	char **sentences = malloc(sizeof(char*));

	while(*ptr != '\0')
	{
		sentences = realloc(sentences, (numSentences + 1)  * sizeof(char*));	
		int sentenceLength = 0;

//		ASSUME A SENTENCE IS NO LONGER THAN 1024 CHARACTERS
		char thisline[ BUFSIZ ];
			
		while(*ptr != '.') 
		{
			thisline[ sentenceLength ] = *ptr;
			sentenceLength++;
			ptr++;
		}
						
//		BE SURE TO APPEND THE FULL STOP TO THISLINE THEN INCREMENT PAST THE FULL STOP. 
//		OTHERWISE FURTHER ATTEMPTS TO ENTER THE ABOVE WHILE LOOP WILL ALWAYS FAIL
		thisline[ sentenceLength ] = '.';
		ptr++;

//		WE ALSO NEED TO APPEND THE NULL-BYTE TO THIS LINE FOR CALLS TO STRDUP
		thisline[ sentenceLength + 1 ] = '\0';
	
//		ADD THE SENTENCE TO AN ARRAY OF SENTENCES

		sentences[ numSentences ] = strdup(thisline);
	
		numSentences++;
	}

	//RETURN THE ARRAY OF SENTENCES

	*nSentences = numSentences;
	return sentences;
}

Okay so this problem is actually a bit trickier than it looks. You've done this:

char*** return_spreadsheet(int nRows, int nCols)
{
	char ***spreadsheet = malloc(sizeof(char*)*nRows*nCols);
	return spreadsheet;
}

So you're declaring spreadsheet as a triple pointer but allocating to it one big array of char* 
(single pointers). Now this actually compiles but when you try to set any element in the 'matrix' 
it gives a segmentation fault. So if you go spreadsheet[0][2] you are accessing the 2nd element 
from row 0 but row 0 doesn't exist yet, hence the seg fault. 

What you need to do is malloc each row individually. Check out this website: 
http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamically-allocate-2d-array-c/

Coming back to your question, yes I reckon you would need to return a structure. Because the last 
question wants to free all space in the spreadsheet, and that involves freeing each row and then 
freeing the spreadsheet.

Yeah managed to figure it out, there's a good explanation in the Stallings textbook
if you have a copy.

Essentially with 16 bit logical addresses, where the offset is 10 bits, this leaves
a 6 bit page number.
Page size is determined by the offset, 2^10 = 1024 = 1K.
The number of pages is hence bounded by the 6 bit page number, 2^6 = 64 pages.

A 16-bit system can hence manage a maximum of 64 pages of 1Kb in size = 64 Kb of memory.

Hope this makes sense, Plenty of diagrams floating around.

You might want to use something bigger than BUFSIZ but in general people don't write sentences longer

Hi Chris

When we are answering the function questions in the exams what exactly are you 
looking for. Are you looking for us to hand write a block of code or to simply 
explain what the function will do. For example would it be better to write 

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
   printf("Hello, World!");
   return 0;
}

or

1. include stdio.h other necessary libraries
2. use a function to print Hello, World! in main
3. Signify execution is finished by returning 0.

Would the above be accepted and marked similarly or is one better than the other

Thanks

Someone emailed me this question;  best that everyone sees it:

  Hello,
  I was looking back to the revision lecture, and you said that if we weren't comfortable
  with dealing with pointers in an exam situation to instead use arrays for the questions 
  (if I understood that right). So how would we go about this?  Would we have to write in
  code to convert them somehow, or simply rewrite the function to take arrays (e.g. void
  countEntries char *dirName --> void countEntries char dirName[])


You may be a bit confused; there's no general purpose technique to convert a pointer to an 
array, or vice-versa.

I think you'd be best served by reviewing Labsheet 5, Q1, where we wrote several identical 
string-processing functions, each with an array-based version and a pointer-based version.

Just a small thing: it says that we need to "return a dynamically allocated array of dynamically allocated 
strings", but we're using thisLine, which is a 1024-character-long array. So I guess we'd have to use a 
pointer and realloc for extracting each sentence into thisLine?

It's not so much reading/writing binary files in itself that is causing concern, 
it's the sheer amount of functions/concepts/ideas that we have to memorise, even 
though we'll probably only be examined on less than 25% of it. Just the possibility 
of being examined on a single concept (and the potential need to know how to use 
particular function) means that we have to study it, even if it's unlikely to come 
up (because if we ignore it, then we risk losing 10 marks out of 60 straight away).

It's not a complaint, I guess that's just the nature of CITS exams, especially 
given it's a level 2 unit.

 From man strdup:

The strdup() function allocates sufficient memory for a copy of the string s1, does the copy, and returns a 
pointer to it. 

So in this line:

sentences[ numSentences ] = strdup(thisline);

we are making a dynamically allocated copy of our local variable thisline. The beauty of it is that strdup 
only allocates space up to the null-byte, which we've appended to thisline. Indeed strdup doesn't even know 
that thisline is an array because, it just does its business until it hits the null-byte.

Yes, I do appreciate the pressure (as I see it every year).
But your sentence, above, does summarise it - 2nd and 3rd year units have to ramp up the 
pace and contents to ensure that everything required by our 2 accreditation bodies is 
covered.

As our School's Teaching Chair, I've been looking into how we're going to manage this from 
2nd semester next year, when UWA changes to 12 week semesters, and still expects students to 
devote 150 hours of study to each unit.

(perhaps a bit lucky that I had to cancel 2 lectures this year and, I believe, still get a 
reasonable coverage).

While I appreciate that Professors have research to do, I've always thought semesters should be
longer. 

It's pretty difficult to get up to speed with an entire sub field of a scientific discipline in
13 weeks. Now, as you've just indicated, the time frame is going to be even shorter. 

Seriously bizarre IMHO... just say'n!

I appreciate the sentiments, but the changes to the university calendar (and semester lengths) are not 
entirely driven to increase research time.  There's a bunch of other changes occurring too, such as 
moving Graduation Ceremonies from March/April to December (which will enable many more international 
students to attend), and the introduction of an 8-week Summer Semester (material delivered faster) so 
that students can accelerate their degree progression or catch-up (repeat) any core units that they've 
failed. The 12-week semesters will, apparently, bring UWA into line with many other Australian 
universities, and make it easier for students undertaking study abroad or interstate (either to or from 
UWA).

That'd be true if all, even any, fields, topics, languages, were currently covered precisely in 13-
weeks because that's all there was to learn.  Looking at other universities in Australia and overseas, 
it's easy to see that they present units such as "An Introduction to XXX" and do so in anywhere between 
8 and 20 weeks, either by doing it faster or covering more material  (you likely won't agree, but it'd 
be difficult to present some material any slower than UWA does).  There's nothing magical about the 
number 13.

Yes to a very small degree, BUT comments reinforce/clarify what code is doing, so don't 
provide comments as a substitute for the required code.

Let's start with some basics, mapping the question's English description into C code.
A spreadsheet consists of a rectangular array of cells, yet your definition defines a type named a 
Cell which includes (as a structure member) a spreadsheet.  Wrong way around.

> typedef struct
> {

We don't know, until runtime, how big each rectangular array of cells needs to be (and a single 
program may manage multiple spreadsheets, each having a different size), so we cannot define fixed 
sized arrays in your structure.  Moreover, you cannot provide the name of a variable to provide 
the size of a dimension, because we're defining a type at *compile time* and the variable will not 
have a value until *runtime*.

Read earlier comments in this thread, which explain why we don't, and can't, use strcpy() to swap 
columns, and only need to swap the values of pointers.

Nope. d_name is the file name not the full path. So future calls to opendir() will succeed 
only for subdirectories (because we're in the parent directory), not for subsubdirectories, 
subsubsubdirectories, and so on.

Okay first of all, the question wants the entire spreadsheet to be a structure, not each 
cell. Like this:

typedef struct 
{
    char ***spreadsheet; // MATRIX OF STRINGS - OUR SPREADSHEET
    int nrows;
    int ncols;
} SPREADSHEET;

2. You can't create a 2-dimensional array with one call to malloc. This is because malloc 
allocates n bytes of contiguous memory and returns a pointer to the first one - by 
definition it returns a 1-dimensional array. So where you've written:

CELL **spreadsheet = malloc(rows * columns * sizeof(CELL));

malloc does return space for rows*columns CELLs, but they are in an array not a matrix. 
Malloc also doesn't initialise them to anything so they are probably NULL. 
Hence the value spreadsheet[0], which you think is a row of CELLs, is NULL. And 
spreadsheet[0][0] is trying to deference a null-pointer so that explains your seg fault. 

You need to allocate space for each row individually. Try this website:
http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamically-allocate-2d-array-c/

You legend it all just clicked, my previous approach was to create a 2D array of cells and loop 
over allocating memory for each one so luckily it's only a few lines I have to change in my 
code, cheers again!

Hi! As far as I've read and seen from past inquiries, the comments are not marked and are not 
required, but if you feel that the code you wrote might be misinterpreted, comments would be 
helping to state more clearly what you want to do.
Perhaps commenting would be good to remark an important step?

Adding comments are a 'no-brainer', take almost no time to add as you write your code, and don't leave

If you look at past exams, you will see most questions give you an overview of the functionality 
required of something like a data structure. e.g. the question might say something along the lines 
of :

"Queues are a classic data structure in computer science, used in a ...... etc. 
Implement a queue data structure _using a self-referential approach_, given the following 
requirements of a queue: 

1) a queue must do blah
2) a queue must allow for this boundary condition
3) the tutors obviously spend a lot of time reading Chris' exam papers" etc. etc.

Given this is a systems programming unit, not a data structures unit, if you are to be asked to 
implement a data structure, you will likely be given the requirements of the implementation in the 
question. 

Hope this clears things up.

For this question, I just wanted to calrify if i'm interpreting it correctly as I am 
pretty unsure. For the first part "Define a C99 data structure to define an instance 
of the 2-dimensional spreadsheet"
What I did was to  define a structer named CELL which holds a char* and 2 ints 
representing the column number and row number. Then defined a 2d array of the 
structure CELL as the spreadsheet. Is this a suitable solution, or have I horrible 
miss-interpreted what it ment. Thanks in advance.

Please have a look at the 2, maybe 3, existing threads on this topic, that already provide 
and explain more correct approaches.

Yes, this part's correct, but in your allocation code, I cannot see you allocating, first, a 
structure, populating it with a 2D array of strings (i.e. a pointer to a vector of pointers, 
each element of which points to a vector of strings, each element of which is a string), or 
the structure 'remembering' how many rows and columns are actually in the spreadsheet.

Get these correct first.

Was hoping to get some input on my solution to the spreadsheet question. 

I've implemented it as a 1 dimensional array of CELL structs. Here it is:

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <limits.h>

#define ROWS    5
#define COLS    5

typedef struct {
    int row;
    int col;
    char *val;
} CELL;

CELL *makeSpreadSheet(int numRows, int numCols)
{
    CELL *spreadSheet;

    if ((spreadSheet = malloc((numRows * numCols) * sizeof(CELL))) == NULL) 
    {
        perror(NULL);
        exit(1);
    }

    int j = 0; 
    for (int i = 0; i < ROWS * COLS; i++)
    {
        if (i % 5 == 0) j++;
        spreadSheet[i].row = j;
        spreadSheet[i].col = i % 5 + 1; 
        spreadSheet[i].val = "string";
    }

    return spreadSheet;
}

void setVal(CELL *spreadSheet, int row, int col, char *val)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < ROWS * COLS; i++)
    {
        if (spreadSheet[i].row == row && spreadSheet[i].col == col)
        {
            spreadSheet[i].val = val;
        }
    }   
}

void swapCol(CELL *spreadSheet, int col1, int col2)
{
    int sentinel = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < ROWS * COLS; i++)
    {
        if (spreadSheet[i].col == col1) 
        {
            spreadSheet[i].col = sentinel;
        }
        else if (spreadSheet[i].col == col2) 
        {
            spreadSheet[i].col = col1;
        }
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < ROWS * COLS; i++)
    {
        if (spreadSheet[i].col == sentinel)
        {
            spreadSheet[i].col = col2;
        }
    }
}

void printSpreadSheet(CELL *spreadSheet)
{
    printf("\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < ROWS * COLS; i++) 
    {
        if (i % ROWS == 0 && i != 0) printf("\n");
        printf("(%d,%d) %s\t", spreadSheet[i].row, spreadSheet[i].col,
spreadSheet[i].val);

    }
    printf("\n\n");
}

void deallocate(CELL *spreadSheet)
{
    free(spreadSheet);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    CELL *spreadSheet = makeSpreadSheet(ROWS, COLS);
    setVal(spreadSheet, 2, 3, "toswap"); 
    printSpreadSheet(spreadSheet); 
    swapCol(spreadSheet, 3, 2); 
    printSpreadSheet(spreadSheet);
    deallocate(spreadSheet);
    return 0;
}

Output after swapping col 3 with col 2:

(1,1) string	(1,2) string	(1,3) string	(1,4) string	(1,5) string	
(2,1) string	(2,2) string	(2,3) toswap	(2,4) string	(2,5) string

(5,1) string	(5,2) string	(5,3) string	(5,4) string	(5,5) string	


(1,1) string	(1,3) string	(1,2) string	(1,4) string	(1,5) string

You fixed part of it, but now you haven't allocated memory for the top level of the array. 
You need to allocate memory for every level of the pointer, if that makes sense.

Not, ideally, information to *memorize*, but information to know and understand.
Sufficient detail to form a correct answer might not appear neatly in lecture notes, but may 
been spoken about, and will certainly appear in relevant sections of a textbook.

When should you use stat() - e.g. S_ISDIR(stat_buffer.st_mode) to find out whether a 
file is a directory 

  VS

simply using dp -> d_type (dp is a DIR pointer)?


The stat_buffer stuff seems clunky to me, and I'm worried that I won't be able to 
memorise its syntax/functions (e.g. st_mode, st_mtime, etc) for the exam...

d_type is a BSD extension and will not 
always be part of the dp struct.

Yea I'd say to always use stat() rather than the  struct dirent  fields, cos that's 
what Chris has been using. From lecture 19:

What is each "thing" found in the directory - is it a directory, is it a file...?

To answer those questions, we need to employ the POSIX function, stat(), to 
determine the attributes of the items we find in directories

Looks pretty good to me maybe less reliance on hard coded assumed values and more realloc will 
possibly make it better?

Sorry if this comes across as a bit arrogant but if you read the question and plan it, it's 
actually not too bad - like most of the questions in the past exams they can be difficult but 
they're definitely possible with a bit of thought. 

Just draw a lot and plan a lot. I think I'd rather spend 15 minutes planning and 5 minutes 
actually writing code rather then getting halfway through my code and realising I've messed 
up.

Hi Chris,
I began writing all the question numbers 
in the box that said "indicate all the 
questions you completed, in order", but 
the invigilator said that it was not 
needed, so I left most of the boxes blank 
(although I completed every single 
question) and forgot to fill them out at 
the end. This shouldn't be a problem, but 
just wanted to check with you?

The results and feedback for the 2nd project are now available in csmarks.

The project average for submitted projects from 226 students was 28.8/40 (26.3/40 from 173 
students in 2016).

The project contributed 15% of the unit's assessment; we'd originally announced that the 
project would be marked out of 40 (20 marks for manual code inspection, and 20 marks for 
automated testing) but automated testing of background processes proved too difficult to be 
performed accurately.  Instead, some additional automated tests of the other steps were 
added, providing 24 marks, and the total mark then capped at 40 marks; this appears to have 
provided a better outcome for all.

Unfortunately, I've referred 19 students to the Faculty's Academic Conduct Advisor, and their 
2nd project and overall marks will be withheld until the matter is resolved.

Exam marking has also been completed.  The average mark for completed exams was 34.3/60 for 
248 students (31.2/60 for 184 students in 2016).  UWA will be releasing all 2nd semester 
results on Dec 18th (if not before) and your exam mark will then be available via csmarks.  
10 students have been offered a deferred exam in late January.

To meet the Faculty's scaling policy, the unit was scaled by 7.8% overall (by 11% in 2016).  
I believe that this reflects that the marking of the projects and exam, this year, were all a 
bit more generous.

Thank you to those who responded to the 2nd project survey.  Your feedback and comments, for 
all to see, are available from http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/feedback/

Thanks very much to both Trent and Ryan for helping with the unit this semester, undertaking 
their large marking bundles in good time, and stepping in when I was away from UWA.

Good luck.
Hope to see you next year in Networks and Security '3002.

Our group - myself (Nicholas Pizzino) and Austin Hooper - placed a ".txt" extension in Project 1 and are waiting 
patiently for your response when you are finished with the other commitments.

left me feeling empty inside.
