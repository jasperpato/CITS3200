It is recording, streaming is difficult as I often use the overhead projector for illustrating concepts. But the recording will be available within 30 minutes of the lecture.

Hello James,

You're in the same situation as (guessing) about 90% of students in this unit - have some 
programming experience in other languages at an introductory level, such as Java or Python, but 
no prior experience in C.

So on that point you have nothing to fear, and you'll be learning new material at the same pace 
as your peers.

We're using the Friday workshops to introduce the software used in the unit, and to develop 
examples in the workshop (an activity termed 'live coding').  In this Friday's workshop we'll be 
answering your question, and others, and those from other students.  It'll be a wall of new 
knowledge, at first.

There's no single or simple answer to your question, but we'll be aiming to get all students to 
use (similar) variants of the same Linux operating-system, and using a program termed a compiler 
to convert human-readable C code into executable machine code.

Before Friday's workshop we'll be preparing and releasing some notes and URLs to help you get 
started.

See you on Friday,

As Chris has written, he will show you the basics this Friday. I would
just add that we need almost nothing except a C compiler and a text
editor. You have to type the C program in the text editor, save it with
a .c extension, and then use the gcc compiler to compile it. The compiler
will produce an executable file(it is called a.out by default in a linux
system), but you can give it another name using compiler options. You
have to then type the name of the executable and press the 'enter'
key to run it.

There are of course IDEs (Integrated Development Environment) for writing
and compiling C code, but we don't need anything more than what I have
described above.

Perhaps the microphone volume is too high, I will reduce the volume. But I don't think giving subtitle is possible.

Hi,

I see this friday being referred to a "workshop" but CAS shows it as a 1 hour LecTute.

Will this friday be the only "workshop" in replacement of the LecTute or will there be 
a workshop every friday and it is currently labelled incorrectly?

Also will this be recorded and available online, as the enrolment on CAS allows it to 
be and unfortunately I will not able to attend this weeks workshop despite its seeming 
importance, so watching it online afterwards is a necessity for me.

Thanks :)

Yes, as 'anonymous' mentioned, so sort of a transcript is available, you can have a look at it.

It is not labelled incorrectly. It has been labelled as "LecTute" so that it is recorded (some kind of admin complication that we need not bother about). It will be held each week, it will be recorded and will be available in LMS.

(this is pre-empting some of the discussion we'll have in Friday's workshop)

There are 3 main contemporary operating systems used by our students - Windows, Linux, and macOS.  Remembering that this 
unit is not just about the (very portable) C programming language, and is also about the programming-language/OS 
interface, it is essential that as many students as possible have the opportunity to use the platform on which the 
teaching materials will focus.

[[Historic note - For a couple of years, this unit has required that all projects be marked on a Linux system, and not 
simply any system of students' choosing.  This improves fairness and repeatability in the marking process.  Until 2018, 
the Dept had a laboratory of Apple iMac computers, and all students' projects were marked on those computers. But due to 
the rising costs on Apple computers (perhaps resulting in decreased student ownership), the university now provides a 
recent version of the Linux operating system on lab computers in CSSE.  Last year was quite a nightmare for project 
markers and students alike, as access to the common Linux lab distribution was unavailable when the campus was locked-
down, and attempting to determine on which platform students developed their project created many headaches.]]

Knowing that students own a mix of Windows, Linux, and macOS, we're providing documentation to explain the options, the 
best of which (we believe) is to run the Ubuntu distribution of Linux on any of the 3 platforms. Unfortunately, the Linux 
distribution installed in CSSE Lab 2.03 is not Ubuntu, and its licensing prevents us from providing a copy to students.  
However, we're aware of the relevant differences between the lab installation and Ubuntu.  The chosen option is suitable 
for Windows-10 users, macOS users (on Intel or Apple Silicon, with or without the T2 chip), and doesn't require 
repartitioning your disk.

So, while students will be able to attempt most of the laboratory and project exercises on other platforms, such as macOS 
or Windows, all students are STRONGLY encouraged to become sufficiently familiar with Linux to undertake the laboratory 
and project exercises, and to test the projects ON the Linux platform before they're submitted.

More details provided in Friday's workshop.

I would like to mention something here. This is not a unit where you
can gather some information and pass an examination, or do well. This
unit requires regular work and thinking. The concepts take time to sink
in. I have taught CITS2200 for many years, and Chris has taught CITS2002
for many years, and he can comment, the students who do well in these
units work regularly. From my experience, students who performed really
badly in CITS2200 over the years, are the ones who did not work regularly
during the semester. CITS2002 is a hard unit unless you work regularly,
please remember this. All the best,

The reason both Ross LT and Clews LT have been mentioned in CAS is due
to the small capacity of each venue compared to the total enrollment in
this unit. Chris will  present in Ross, and our guess is that the number
of students attending can be accommodated in Ross. The same material
will be projected in Clews in case Ross is full. So, try the Ross LT
first. The session will be recorded and will be uploaded to LMS.

(a more descriptive Subject will help everyone out, particularly as the number of different topics 
grows)

Whether using the Linux operating system natively (booted from its own disk partition), using Linux 
within some virtual environment under Windows or macOS,  or even on macOS itself, we'll use the 
*native* C compiler for the platform.

The native C compiler under Linux is named gcc, and under macOS is named clang  (and more 
confusingly, gcc may also be installed on macOS, and clang may be installed on Linux).

HOWEVER, don't worry about which actual compiler is in place on your system.
While you can invoke  gcc  or clang  to identify exactly which you want, it's best to just invoke  
cc  (standing for C Compiler),  and that will run the native compiler on your system, regardless of 
which it is.

Not Chris,

Firstly, yeah they are in a way interchangeable they are just basically allow the user(Us) 
and/or programs to interact with the operating system. 

Secondly, depends on what OS you are using for your command line. Google it("How to alter 
terminal on OSX" something like that.

Thirdly, Can't help you there sorry.

Many textbook authors and writers on the internet will use the terms interchangeably, so it takes a bit of context to 
work out what's being discussed.  Pedantically, they 3 are distinct things, so sorry if that wasn't clear from Friday's 
workshop.

A *terminal* program renders and manages the rectangular graphical window, rendering colours, fonts, etc, and responds 
to keyboard, mouse, and scrollbar events. Some common examples include xterm (on Linux), and Terminal and iTerm2 (on 
macOS):

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terminal_emulators

A terminal runs as an operating system process, and can itself created and manage one or more other processes, receive 
the direct *their* keyboard events, and receive and render the character output of those processes.  While terminal 
programs can usually permit each of these other processes to be individually specified, each is usually an instance of a 
*shell* program. If a terminal program simultaneously runs several shell processes, each is usually managed within a 
separate tab (as on a browser) to separate their inputs and outputs.  We often say that these other processes runs 
'behind' the terminal process.

A *shell* program is the thing that issues a prompt, receives a line of character input, breaks the line into space- and 
tab-separated words, and based on the first word on each line performs and 'internal' action, or executes and waits for 
an external program (such as 'date', 'cal', or 'cc'). When the shell creates an external process, it passes to that 
process each of the words from the command-line as its arguments, so that the process knows what to do: 'cal -y',
'cc -o try try.c',  etc.
Of note, the shell does not know what any of the words/arguments mean, and just passes them on.
When each new process produces some character-based output, it is received and rendered by the terminal process.

*bash* is one type of shell program,  just like C and Java are types of programming languages. There's many different 
shells - others include zsh (the default on macOS), zsh, csh, ash, rc, ...)  Each different shell supports/recognizes a 
different syntax, but each has the same primary role of creating and managing other processes.

 
> 2-) Just curious, how did you change the colour of your shell's background (or 
> terminal or what ever)?

(with respect to the descriptions above) I use iTerm2 on macOS (highly recommended!).  It supports 'profiles' which 
group together (the program/shell to run, the size of the window, the background and foreground colours, the font, ...)
Other terminal programs have their own mechanisms for setting these attributes and, as suggested,  you'll need to read 
their manuals or online documentation.
This from 2004!  https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/debian-26/how-to-change-background-and-fonts-color-in-xterm-156290/



> 3-) When you were in the vi editor, how do you switch between the two modes? What do 
> you press?

vi is always in one of two modes - command-mode (the starting state) and insert-mode.  You move to insert-mode by 
invoking an insertion command (such as i for insert or a for append).  From there you stay in insert-mode until you

Following the last Friday's workshop, Chris said something on the lines of creating 
video instructions on how to install Ubuntu as a linux operating system.

I might have missed it, but I couldn't find anything on installation instructions on 
LMS and the CITS2002 website as of Monday (2/08/2021).

So I was wondering for my operating system(Windows 10), was it recommended to install 
Linux on a Virtual OS using Ubuntu?

Thanks in advance.

Can't give a definitive time, yet.  It will likely be a list of instructions and links to follow, rather 
than a video, as there's too many combinations to consider (and you'll only be interested in one of 
them).

The 'obvious' response is that you may be able to attend the labs in the CSSE building, where Linux is installed and running on lab 
computers in Lab 2.03,  but that will not work for everyone.

The recommendations (which are not instructions) appear at the head of the Section 'Labsheet 1 
tasks', on https://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/labsheets/labsheet1.php
but they only point you in the right direction.

As atated in the other thread, attending a CSSE lab is a definite option (if possible) until I 
can finish some instructions.

"i" (enter) gets you into "text editing" mode where you type programming lines.  
"esc" key puts you into "command mode" - e.g. when you type stuff, it shows up at the bottom of 
the window instead of altering text in the programming lines - type  ":w" "enter" to save your 
VIM file, and type ":q""enter" to get out of the VI window back into your linux command window

Dear, lecturer.

Due to many questions raised during the lab sessions, I wasn't able to ask questions I did 
not understand. In this case, what is the best option you can provide to students?

When I was taking the Software engineering with Java Unit, they have provided us with the 
sample solutions, and this has given me a great guidance towards learning. Would it be 
possible if you are able to provide students with some sample solutions uploaded on CSSE?
That would be much appreciated.

Kind regards.

Yes, there will be sample solutions to all Labsheets, the Workshops, and the Projects.

They will be released, via our Schedule page, *after* each respective event has been completed -
e.g. the last weekly lab sessions are held on Fridays, workshops on Fridays, and students can submit 
project (with penalty) for up to a week after a project's deadline.  Sample solutions will be released
on those 'closing' days (or the next day).

Hi, hope all is well.

I was curious what role linux has in this unit, So far I have completed the workshop 
and first lab with no problems inside my existing macOS in Terminal. Will later parts 
of the unit require us to run Linux inside docker to achieve required results? What is 
the intention in our use of linux if, so far, it has not been necessary? I'm assuming 
the process of using it would be extremely similar although running Linux inside 
docker and using the shell connected to the Linux container (I'm guessing files are 
shared between host and container)?

Also, It has been stated before that we will be using vim/vi for this unit instead of 
a traditional IDE, I find vim slow and clumsy to edit and write code - is it a must to 
use vim instead of, say, VSCode? I'm guessing you're requiring us to use vim to allow 
for a barebones approach and to get us familiarised with the use of shell instead of 
relying on GUI, is this correct? Or are there other reasons.

Thanks for your help :)

Just in case you haven't seen it yet,  there's a new link, in red, on the homepage's left menu 
describing the recommended options for installing Linux on students' common platforms.
Still plenty to add, but plenty of reading there already.

Sorry, forgot to add that this help2002 forum is also a recommended place to ask questions about the 
labsheets, workshops, and projects.  It's the single place guaranteed to be read by our unit's
teaching staff (and hopefully many other students), so you'll get relevant replies.

For the assessed projects, you certainly should not post very specific questions or code that gives 
away any part of the solution to other students, but you're encouraged to ask for any necessary 
clarifications, or to discuss general questions about possible approaches.

There's a few solid reasons for focusing on a single operating system
platform in this unit. The unit has chosen Linux, because it's the world
most widely used OS (even if not on desktops). So it's a vital component
of a student's computing education to be exposed to Linux, and not to
hope that they can just 'cruise' through their degree in the comfort of a
single platform.  This is even more important in a systems-focused unit.
Different CSSE units will have different requirements and opportunities;
for example, in recent years when I've taught Computer Networks, students
were given a choice of programming languages for their project (in fact,
they had to write the project in *two* languages).

Linux can run on the laptop and desktop computers likely owned by
students, making it 'easy' to give students equitable access to the same
platform, enabling students to (eventually) ask and answer questions
about a single platform, and the staff and lab facilitators to more
correctly determine what's being asked.  We had A LOT of difficulty
with the issue last year, as students couldn't attend campus (labs)
and worked on the variety of platforms to which they had access.

Also, pragmatically, to enable project marking and feedback to be as quick
as possible, we need all students to submit work that will be marked on a
single system, and not just on their system of choice;  given the class
size, we don't have the time to mark projects on different platforms,
allowing for the differences between them.

I don't doubt that you've been able to complete the first labsheet and
workshop on macOS (where I do most of my work, too).  But please reflect
on the fact that the first exercises have been chosen to be simple,
introductory, and have made no demands of the OS, and have focused
on writing (simple) programs in a (new) portable programming language.
Later exercises will make demands of the platforms, involving system-calls
(the functional interface between your application programs and the OS)
which are different (and are documented differently) across platforms.

Many of my points about choosing Linux apply here, too.  But it's
never been stated that you must use vi/vim, and their use will not
be examined/assessed.  Your last point is the most relevant - in a
systems-focused unit we believe it's important to expose students to
utilities, such as text editors, that they may see in their careers.
Your favourite graphical editor may not always be available on a platform
you're using, or have to use, particularly over networks (but, yes,
programming life is changing all the time).  There's a reasonable number
of common text editors also widely available - emacs, nano, joe...).
Vi/vim ranks very highly amongst regular users of command-line editors
(and, yes, it's my favourite).

___

You've asked good questions (without fear!), and the reasons are a mix
of exposing students to something other than Windows and GUIs, outside
of their comfort zone,  and to benefit the pragmatics of running a
large unit.

In the long term, students see the benefits of learning different things
and occasionally working outside of their comfort zone - in later year
units (by choice), when applying for careers requiring a breadth of
skills, and (for some) in research.  These different skills are chosen
because they are relevant to the unit's core material, not just to make
life difficult!

Hello,

For the particular benefit of students stuck outside of Perth, there are two 2 hour online 
laboratory sessions each Friday (12-2, 2-4) at which students will be able to gain 
assistance from laboratory demonstrators. You may attend these online laboratories via MS 
Teams.

The link is on the unit's homepage, under 'Weekly Activities'.

No, labs are not assessed, just the 2 projects and the final exam.

I don't know what was done in DSA; Amitava or others may have a comment.
But most of the (future) lab questions won't have solutions that can be automatically tested as just right/wrong (likely the 
projects will, but they take a long time to set up).

Hi,

This a really a more general issue about how to access your Windows or macOS files while working 
inside docker+Linux.   Until familiarity grows, you'll probably find the following way easiest, as 
it:

  - gives you the ability to read and write your local files while in docker,
  - allows you to use your standard browser to download files (such as rotate.c)
  - (assuming that you're performing backups) files created/changed in docker will be backed up.

I've tested this on macOS, but not Windows (anyone else able to test this??)

Using the Docker Desktop (GUI) we first need to indicate that docker is permitted to access your 
local files (only required once):

   - DockerDesktop > Settings(button) > Resources > FileSharing > add(+) the name of your local directory
   - Apply & Restart

(on my Mac I added /Users/chris, which is my full home directory, but you could set just a
sub-directory for specific CITS2002 work).

Now, when you run docker, we need to add some command-line arguments:

  docker run --rm -it -v /Users/chris:/home/chris -w /home/chris --name ubuntu ubuntu:latest bash

(use your name, ANONYMOUS, not chris :-)

Now, when your Linux shell starts in docker, your present working directory will be /home/chris, 
rather than the root directory,  / , a much safer place to work, and you should able to see your 
existing files using  'ls'.

Hope this helps.

Hi,

(been stuck in this prompt all night, or resolved?)

I'm unsure what you mean by 'changed my language' or how just pressing Shift could change that 
but,  in most cases, if you include the character " or ' on the command-line, the line will 
continue until you provide a closing quote - this allows you to add the standard newline 
character into a command, if ever needed.

So you may be able to "get out of the prompt", to the next one, just by providing the matching ".

More generally, if you're entering any new command at the prompt, your can *interrupt* the shell 
by typing Control and C simultaneously - often written Ctrl-C.
This should get you to the next prompt.

Similarly, if you're running a program that is either running too long (or if you're written a 
program with an infinite loop in it!)  you can interrupt it with Ctrl-C.

Try to run and interrupt:

   prompt>  yes hello

Hi Chris,

This helps a lot, but still, a little unclear how to actually open that C file. Are we working in the terminal 
or in the Docker desktop? where are we supposed to actually change the C code according to the labsheet?

Hi,  I'm a bit confused as to where "you're up to" in the steps of:

  http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/labsheets/install-linux.php

If you have a Ubuntu image downloaded and populated with necessary packages - providing the C compiler (essential) and 
your choice of tezt editor (vi/vim recommended if you don't already have a favourite - then you can run a new Linux 
terminal within DockerDesktop, or just through the existing terminal program on your system (my preference, as it saves 
on screen real-estate to use the same terminal program with multiple open tabs).

Then (assuming vi as your editor, and that you have the required C file in your present working directory), you run vi 
and pass the file's name on the command-line:

  prompt>  vi rotate.c

Then you're 'in' vi, and you can issue vi's commands navigate around the file or to edit it (switching backwards and 
forwards between command-mode and insert-mode:

  https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help2002?hl=insert%20mode&a=26 )

When you've made all the edits you wish, you simply leave vi with two capital Z's - ZZ
and you'll be returned to the shell prompt, where you can compile the modified file:

  prompt>  cc -o rotate rotate.c

If there's no compilation errors (otherwise, back to editing....) you can run the successfully compiled program with:

  prompt>  ./rotate  yourstring

Does that help?

I'm assuming that you are using WSL as there is another thread dedicated towards file 
explorer issues with regards with Docker that can be found here:
https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help2002?p=np&a=55

There are several solutions for navigating to your windows home directory with linux, the 
first and most easiest solution would be open the directory on windows explorer and simply 
hold shift and right-click in an empty space in the folder and there should be the option 
"Open Linux shell here" which will open linux and automatically navigate to the 
aforementioned folder (you can type ls to make sure you are seeing the same files).

Alternatively, in linux you can type in "cd /mnt/c/Users/<your account name>/Desktop and 
this will navigate to the desktop folder on your windows account for example.

The shell commands "cd", "ls" and "pwd" will prove very useful when learning to navigate 
and display the current directory structure.

There is also a simpler editor in Ubuntu called 'gedit' 
Just 
$gedit <enter>
will open it, there is a menu at the top-left corner for loading file. There is a save button to save after editing.

The assessments are mentioned in a table in the unit page:

The labs are not assessed, there are two projects, 25% each and a final exam 50%. 
We are not using Moodle (unlike in CITS2200) for CITS2002.

You will need to download a copy of Docker Desktop that suits your system - Windows10, macOS on an Intel 
processor, or macOS on Apple's M1 processor.

Then follow the instructions on the page:

  http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/labsheets/install-linux.php

Starting at the first use of the prompt 'terminal'>' in blue,
cut-and-paste the commands to the right of each blue prompt, in order.
Watch what is displayed on yoru screen (much of it will 'fly past' very quickly.

At their end, you'll have your own configured Ubuntu image with a reasonable set of commands, and documentation, 
to develop, compile, and run C programss.

As stated in today's workshop,  and even posted here:

      https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help2002?hl=solution&a=41
and   https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help2002?hl=solution&a=68
  
the sample solution for WS-2 is already linked on the Schedule page (just below the question's link), 
and the lab solutions will appear when this week' lab (sessions) have completed.

You haven't indicated what system/environment you've using,
but this step from the webpage - https://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/labsheets/install-linux.php

  root@ubuntu.5 apt-get install -y vim build-essential

will install both the vim editor and the (many) packages for the C compiler.
Have you followed those steps,  becuase they should install the 'cc' command for you ?

As it appears that you're in Perth,  you've welcome to attend any of the weekly CITS2002 lab sessions (not just your allocated one), and ask

The first methods you mentioned only allows us to open Powershell, but I am trying to open ubuntu 
which does not work. Second methods resulted in " no such file or directory" Any other way?

My windows 10 docker (WSL2) doesn't have a "fileSharing" option in the dockersDesktop > Settings > resources 
dialog (see 1st screenshot). also, "wget https://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/labsheets/rotate.c" 
in the docker terminal  results in an error (2nd screenshot) 

Attempting the "Shift / Right click / Open Linux Terminal" trick and using "cp rotate.c ~/CITS2002/lab01" 
worked, but only inside the shell it opened (the docker shell couldn't see rotate.c) (2nd screenshot)

I'm not sure if this is related or not, but I also noticed that each time I type "exit" in the docker linux 
shell command interface (and return to the windows command prompt), when i return to the linux command via 
the "run -it --rm --name myubuntu myubuntu bash" command, everything disappears (e.g. the bash_profile file, 
the entire "CITS2002" directory, all the new user "whoops!" files, etc.). Why does this happen? Is there some 
way to use the docker linux command instance but not lose all my files every time we exit the docker linux 
command mode?  Barring that, is it possibly better to just use the "right click -> open linux shell here" 
option to gain access to linux command window that we should be using to start on the lab work and 
potentially the rest of the projects for the semester?

The file "linux-cc-basics.php" is a webpage so, unless you've downloaded it to somewhere on your 
local Windows file-system (such as the Desktop), you will not have it on your local system and, 
thus, cannot display it with 'cat'.

Before running a docker image (to become a container) you need to indicate through its command-
line arguments which parts of your local file-system that docker should able to access.

I believe that this is the same under both Windows and macOS, and has been described here:

  https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help2002?p=np&a=55

You have two typos in your commands:

  cd/mnt/c/Users.....

needs a space to separate the command-name 'cd' from its arguments:

  cd  /mnt/c/Users.....

and  ubuntu:lastest  is spelt  ubuntu:latest

That missing 'fileSharing' option in the Dashboard may only be required/exist on macOS,  perhaps needed to politely

There may be a functionally equivalent mechanism on Windows, or it may not be required at all. ??

Not strictly related but, agreed, you don't wish to lose your working environment each time you exit a container.
Keep your working files for labs and projects within your Windows file system (not within the docker container, which 
will throw them away on exit, unless a new image is created).

My reading of StackOverFlow indicates that this is the same from Windows and macOS, just needing to specify the correct 
path to your Windows files:

Hello,

Was not planning on releasing sample solutions for the harder child questions, and have not in 
previous years.  But they are not assessed, so you should be comfortable to discuss them here.

A hint for Q9 is to use C's standard isdigit() function.

If you don't mind me asking, why waiting? Why don't you just release it immediately 
after the workshop is done on Friday (yesterday) so we can work on it before the lab 
starts on Monday? Since I am done with the last week's lectures and workshops and 
just waiting for the lab to be released to give it a go.

Thanks for the explanation in advance

The 2nd labsheet is now available from our Schedule page.

On 'why waiting?' - your question presumes that everything is just 'ready to go', and just 
needs releasing, in contrast to some things needing to be written or modified first.  The 
sequence and content of teaching materials varies each year, particularly based on our 
perception of how students 'are going', and what needs to be covered before projects are 
released (unfortunately, we're receiving very little feedback at present, but only about half 
of those present at Friday's workshop indicated that they'd completed Labsheet-1).

In addition, there's a finite amount of time that both Amitava and I can devote to teaching, 
and we must schedule other meetings and activities throughout the week;  some must be 
attended to while on campus, others can be attended to from home, even if it's the weekend.  
Amitava is very commendably presenting an extra online lecture to overseas students on 
Saturdays.

Not making excuses, but it's just how it is sometimes - each week can be different, and we're 
unlikely to please everyone all of the time.

Good luck,

Hi Chris/Amitava,

I was doing Lab 1 question 9 and I realize some things:
1. I can use atoi on an argument, but I get an error when I try to use it on the 
individual characters of the argument.
2. I can use isdigit on the individual characters of an argument, but I get an error 
when I try to use it on the argument.

Can you explain why this is the case?

Thanks.

As in most programming languages, the datatypes of a function's parameters, and its returned 
value are very important.  n the case of the atoi() function, its single parameter must be a 
sequence of characters (a string in C), because formatted representations of integers are 
often longer than a single character (e.g. "123").

A single character is not a string, and the value and internal representation of the 
character '3' is different to the string "3".

> 2. I can use isdigit on the individual characters of an argument, but I get an error 
> when I try to use it on the argument.

Similarly, the isdigit() function requires a single character argument, but not a string. In 
all cases, a single character can be checked to see if it's a digit, or not, but strings can 
contain more than a single character - and the function is not named  isnumber().

Amitava will be discussing the relationship and differences between C's characters and 
strings, in Lecture 6, tomorrow.

It's not possible to say, definitively, but nearly all segmentation violations are the result 
of attempting to access memory other than what you program 'owns', or in a manner inconsistent 
with the way it's been declared.

As you're working on the credit card problem, examining individual characters in a string (an 
array of characters), my guess is that you're attempting to access somewhere 'outside' of the 
memory allocated for that string.  Check the indices you're using to access the array's 
characters.

Hey,

I've got a few questions that I need clarifying;

1) When using ubuntu, do I use it through powershell (I use Microsoft) and docker 
desktop, or do I directly use it on ubuntu? (Could be a confusing question but I 
honestly have confused myself siginificantly)

2) I downloaded VIM, supposedly the improved version of Vi, how do I open the rotate.c 
file through VIM?

3) Depending on the answers to the other questions, this one may be negligent but do I 
run an ubuntu (myubuntu) container on powershell then supposedly access the rotate.c 
file through VIM on powershell, and if so how do I access files on my laptop in the 
terminal?

Sorry if these questions have been asked before but I honestly don't know if the other 
questions I've seen are actually asking the same question, just cause I'm befuddled. 
Also I have done this:

Pretty much I'm confused on how to open the C file as to start editing it and 
executing it etc.

Thank you so much.

I'm not a lecturer or a lab facilitator so by all means I could be somewhat wrong.

1) Confusing question but the idea if your intending to use docker is to run ubuntu using 
docker through powershell. Docker is an application that you can interact with through ur 
powershell, the docker application is quite interesting, it creates "images" (think of it as 
a little portal) of different Operating systems (in our case, Ubuntu) within ur local/host OS 
(yours being Windows). 

Within the images there are "containers" (I could be wrong but I imagine they are the 
different user's of the OS), throughout the unit you can create new containers as you like, 
or keep coming back to the same container so your files in that container can be interacted 
with each session. You will be using your powershell to communicate with docker through 
commands and open your little Ubuntu portal, in this portal you should be doing your software 
development in this unit.

2) Navigate to the folder holding rotate.c through your powershell and then type "vim 
rotate.c" to edit the file. However, as stated before this file should be within your 
container, you can do this by using docker commands to copy or simply creating a new c file 
in the container and copy and pasting the text.

3) This question is also confusing and I think it's important to understand the role of 
certain tools we are using:
Docker - application we use to create images of other OS within our host OS, with each 
container representing a different user (with different folders) of those images
VIM - a simple text editor
Powershell - a command driven application that we use to communicate to our OS and it's 
applications.

With that in mind, through powershell we communicate to our docker application and instruct 
it to open our myubuntu container ("portal"). Once opened the prompt will change to "root" 
with a bunch of numbers/letters indicating the powershell is now communicating to the 
container. We then can create our own files in this container, including rotate.c, we can use 
VIM to create such files since it is a text editor (high level software language files are 
essentially just text files with special syntax). Once done you can simply exit your 
container by communicating through powershell to the docker container, putting you back onto 
your host OS command-line (powershell).

I've ommitted specific commands used etc because it would take ages laying them all out, what 
helps is understanding what each tool use is, and then researching how to do certain tasks 
that are in each tools breadth. Such as opening and editing a file in vim, or navigating to a 
different folder in powershell, or creating a new container in your docker container.

Hope this helps.

It is likely that you are using docker and the solution to that can be found in the link in the first 
paragraph of my first reply. If the "Open linux shell here" command does not appear, you should be 
able to run it by opening a powershell window as you mentioned and typing "wsl" in the prompt.

If you are still encountering errors with navigating files or issues regarding commands not found, 
make sure that you are most definitely using wsl with a relevant distro from the microsoft store 
(recommended to use Ubuntu) and you can check this by typing in the command "wsl --list --verbose" in 
powershell as shown below:

If you only have docker-desktop and docker-desktop-data, then you need to check the forum post that 
covers the file access issues regarding docker.

(For Windows Users only) If Ubuntu is shown , make sure there is a star next to it on the left, if 
not, you can type "wsl --set-default Ubuntu" so that running wsl will default to ubuntu rather than 
docker (this usually happens if you've installed docker first before another distro from the microsoft 
store) and you should be able to try installing the prerequisite packages and compiling a c program.

I may be confused, but it appears that you're running Powershell on a Windows, but are 
attempting to execute Linux commands (via bash) that should only be executed while running 
docker.

Hello,

There may be a few things displayed on the screen that just happen 'automatically' as a 
consequence of the normal workflow.  Assuming you've using vim to edit your C source file:

  prompt-123>  vim program.c
  ... the screen clears and vim displays your file
  ... things typed at the keyboard are commands to vim to move around the file or
      or to insert/modify text

  ... having finished editing, you type two capital Zs - ZZ
  ... the modified file is written to disk
  ... vim automatically redisplays the contents of the terminal (as before entering vim)

  prompt-124>
  ... bash issues its next prompt, awaiting your next bash command

There's no need to manually 'switch' the display of anything - vim is doing that for you.

  prompt-124>  cc -std=c11 -Wall -Werror -o program program.c
  ... we ask bash to run the C compiler to compile our program

  prompt-125>  ./program  [any optional command-line arguments]
  ...  and if the compilation was success, we ask bash to execute our program
  ...  any output from our program appears on the same screen/window

  prompt-126>

____
Does that help?

The C compiler is stating that the file  first_day_of_month.c  is not found in the same 
directory as your main C file.  You've downloaded it, and copied there?

Unsure what this means,  but if you've copied the contents of  first_day_of_month.c. 
into your main C file, then you don't need the #include ...  line at all.

It appears there is something wrong with this line of code 
int numbers = strlen(argv[2]);
but i am not sure what, this is in the main function and i am trying to get length of the char* 
argv[2].

That line looks quite harmless - assuming that you're invoking your program with sufficient command-line 
arguments.  You'll be needing:

  ./program  huge  elephant

to be able to get the length of the string  elephant.
Providing sufficient arguments?

Not really a silly question.
I think the answer is 'yes', at least for the labs and the 1st project, but haven't thought enough about the 2nd project, yet.
The likely problem will be the RAM available for your application.

The strong advice, though, is - we'll be marking projects on Ubuntu Linux (and not on Raspberry Pis), so you you should at least transfer, 
compile, and test your project(s) on Ubuntu before submitting them.

But if wishing to experiment with a Raspberry Pi, why not load Ubuntu on it:

  https://ubuntu.com/raspberry-pi

??

Not seen the error before - but it's (only) from macOS.

Have you downloaded the Xcode package, from the App Store?
Did you run xcrun yourself (by typing it in), or did 'cc' throw up that error?

On my (working) Big Sur installation of Xcode, I do not have the file 
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun. either.

My xcrun is located in. /usr/bin/xcrun

What is the output when you run:

You do not need a pointer as the parameter to isdigit() - the only valid parameter is a 
character. However, the whole discussion about pointers and their relationship to character 
strings is coming up in a later lecture:

In effect, if you wish to access the first character of the second command-line argument (a string), 
then want:

    char mychar = argv[1][0];

as if you're accessing a 2-dimensional array or characters.
 
> function,without using it,it shows "sementation fault"

If your program has compiled (without any errors or warnings) and it only crashes when it's 
run, I wonder/suspect that you're not using the suggest switches to 'cc' ?

All variables in C11 may be modified**

So it does not matter whether a variable is defined as a global, or not, or whether it is 
declared as a static, or not - your program will always be able to modify it.

So your problem is more likely to be with the logic of your implementation, not with C's 
variables.


** with the exception of variables declared with the modifier 'const',
   which declares that you have no *intention* of modifying them (sort of read-only).

Yes, 4GB is a lot, though each individual process may be limited to much less, so that 
multiple processes can execute 'simultaneously' - the RPi has no fast disk to swap to!
I don't think our projects will have huge data requirements.

argv[0] is the name of the executable, argv[1]... the other command line arguments. I think you are not passing enough command line arguments. You must  pass least 3 strings for argv[2] to be defined.

Try the ls command to check whether the file is in the current directory, the name should be listed. But as Chris has written, there is no need to include the file if you already have the code in your source file. This is an error message from the preprocessor, it replaces the content of the file mentioned in the #include statement. It gives up when it cannot find the file.

[this is not an advertisement or recommendation for Parallels]

Some students have indicated that they are employed part- or full-time, and that they

employer has been reluctant to permit 'untrusted' software (docker?) to be installed.

This may be an approved option for those studnets (check with your employer):

Parallels Desktop 17 has just been released, which permits Windows (and Linux) to run on 
a Mac (Intel or M1) without rebooting (sounds just like docker!).  See:

  https://www.parallels.com/au/products/desktop/

The annual subscription price is AUD$109, but there's a student licence (for the person, 
not the hardware) for AUD$58 (seemingly works for, cough, staff too):

I was not suggesting that you use 'const' at all.
I was indicating that (nearly) all variables, static, global, ..... can be modified.

So I do not think that that is your problem.

What gives you the suspicion that your variable named 'Rot' is not, or cannot, be modified?

If you have:

   printf("%i\n", Rot );
   Rot = Rot + 1;
   printf("%i\n", Rot );

what happens?

It seems that you're misunderstanding the question,  rather than having any programming problems with variables 
that cannot be modified.

If you invoke your program with, say, the arguments:

    ./rotate9  horse  lion  4  elephant  17  22  budgie  alpaca

then:

   horse will be rotated by 13 (the starting value)
   lion will also be rotated by 13 (unchanged)
   elephant will be rotated by 4 (the new rotation value)
   budgie will be rotated by 22
   alpaca will also be rotated by 22

Does that make more sense?

_____
I'm (genuinely) interested to understand how you read question 9 on the labsheet to mean that it had something 
to do with static or global variables  (so that I can improve the wording of the question).

And what was your evidence that any of your variables could not be modified?

Thanks,

Sorry, but I can't imagine what the problem is, based on what you're described.

My first thought would be that Xcode (and/or the supplementary tools) have not been installed 
correctly,  but I can't tell that for sure.  If it's a laptop, are you able to bring it in to 
UWA?  Perhaps email me to arrange a time  (not before 2PM today).

Hi ANONYMOUS,

I found the following StackExchange posting by searching for some of the specific text from the error message:
  https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/254380/why-am-i-getting-an-invalid-active-developer-path-when-attempting-to-use-git-a

Unfortunately I don't have access to an Apple system to test (and this question was asked about errors with `git`, not `cc`), but I suspect the solution proposed will also work for your case.

Try running the command

    $ xcode-select --install

and then invoking `cc` after that is done.

The post also links to an Apple technical note (https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2339/_index.html) that explains a little more about what xcrun and CommandLineTools are.

You can only read strings from the command line, if you want an argument to be an integer, you have to use the atoi() (ascii to integer) function. Is that the problem?

OK, sounds like you're getting it now.

When a program runs, it starts with a 'fresh' copy of its variables (held in memory).
When a process terminates, its final values of its variables are entirely forgotten
(and the memory it was using will soon be used by another process).

No information about a previosuly running program is remembered for the next time it runs -
UNLESS that program, itself, saves some information somewhere, such as by using a file on disk,
reading/creating the file each time the program runs, and writing information each time the program finishes.

I think I can see where your earlier confusion with the keyword 'static' came from, but in this context it only means within each 
*single* execution of a program,  not across multiple executions.

Good luck,

Hi, I'm attempting to solve Q6 in this week's lab but I'm not sure how to approach it. 
When the user inputs the "numbers", they are recorded as an array of strings.

I would like to use for loops to see if the last char of each string is == '1' or == 
'2' etc so I can print the appropriate ordinal description. However I am unable to 
know whether the user will input a number that is a one, tens, hundreds... which 
limits my for loops.

Is there any way to overcome this issue? Or a better way to think about this question?

Thanks for your help!

Get rid of the strings as quickly as possible - convert them to integers, then use basic 
arithmetic (division and modulus using/by 10) to determine the digits of the numbers.

Characters *are* integers,  they are just small (1-byte) integers.

But that's not the question you're wishing ask.
You're probably noticing that the character expressed as '0' does not have the (integer) value 
of zero.

Compiling and running this loop may help:

    for(char ch = '0' ; ch <= '9' ; ++ch) {
        printf("'%c' == %i\n",  ch, ch);
    }

I was just logged into a staff-only Linux machine, across the wireless network, and had set my shell's 
prompt (with the intention of it being less confusing. Failed that)

You may set your shell prompt to anything you choose with commands such as:

  PS1="santa-claus.\! "

See:  https://man.archlinux.org/man/bash.1#PROMPTING

(as very quickly explained in today's workshop)

The traditional (40+ year old) way to run the vim editor is inside the
same window that receives your shell commands.  I choose to edit files and
compile them in the same window during workshops (and in most of my work)
to simply save screen real-estate.  So you can run the vim editor in the
single window by simply executing the 'vim file.c' command at the prompt,
and then leaving the editor with either

    :wq!<RETURN>
or  ZZ

when finished editing  (or just  :q!  to quit without saving changes).

The second part is more complex, and will be covered later in the unit.
Processes may be in one of a number of states - (simplified definition):

  - running in the foreground, receiving keyboard input
  - suspended, not running, receiving no input, or
  - running in the background, receiving no input.

When working (as in today's workshop) I first invoke a copy of the vim
editor, and it runs in the foreground receiving input from the keyboard.
I then type 2 keys at once - Control-Z - which suspends the vim process.
The shell notices this, and issues the next prompt, and which I can
run the compiler again (or any other commands).  When I wish to resume
execution of the vim process - shifting it from suspended to foreground -
I type 'fg', the shell becomes suspended, vim resumes, detects that it's
again running in the foreground, and redraws the screen.

For this sequence to be effective, you also need the editor to write
its changes to disk before becoming suspended. Either you can do this
manually, which gets tiring and you may forget, or you can ask vim to
do it automatically by setting an internal vim setting -

  :set autowrite<RETURN>

Then, just before vim is suspended it writes its changes to disk, and
the next compilation, etc, will be performed using the updated C file.

In much the same way that shell aliases can be saved between visits,
vim's settings can also be saved in a file named  ~/.vimrc   which you
can edit with vim itself, appending the line:

  set autowrite     (no leading colon).

Yes that does help thank you. 
Now I understand that internally characters are represented by integer. For example '0' is 
represented by 48 in the machine. 
So when I did int temp = '2' - 48; or int temp = '2' - '0'; I got the integer equivalent because 50 - 
48 = 2. 

Thank you very much once again.

Ok, so week 4 is here, and I really need assistance getting the essential programs running correctly so I can actually complete some labs.
I am running Windows, and how now downloaded docker/ubuntu like 3 times a week attempting to get them installed and running correctly. 
I am not sure if i am missing something, but having zero experience with docker/ubuntu/linux i have no clue how to get the setup working correctly.

I know none of the commands for navigating in ubuntu, or vim. have i
missed a workshop or link to some basic commands?(yes i understand that
i am a university student and that google exists, but at what point does
the fact I am paying for a course kick in? this is a c coding course,
not an ubuntu/docker course?)

there seems to be a large expectation that we will know how to use
ubuntu and vim commands, without actually showing us or explaining how
the carry out basic activities and navigation commands.

So currently, i run ubuntu and vim fine, have manages to install wget
(didnt seem to install with the commands provided), and even managed to
save the image of this to ensure it is also there next time i log in.

now if I work on a file, and exit ubuntu/docker, and then try and go
back into my file, it does not exist anymore. I attempted to allow
docker access to a directory through settings-resources as described in
a previous help topic.

I am completely frustrated that so far 3 weeks have passed and I (and
from what i can tell, a lot of people) still am not sure if the programs
i need for this course are installed and working correctly.

Assistance would be muchly appreciated.

Hey guys, 

I have been asked on how to access windows files using docker.
I'm a past student.

Try to do this:

1) Press RUN on docker in Images (following this units tutorial its myubuntu),
2) Before you press RUN again press Optional Settings
3) Set the host path to the file you want to access in host path.
EG: S:\docker_shared
you can press the three dots to select a folder
4) Set container path to /shr (or what you like)
4.5)Set a nice name for your new container if you like
5) Press RUN
6) You can now access your windows files in the shr folder on ubuntu in docker container 

congrats

Your background knowledge and experience is not different to that of
many students in the unit, but it seems that you're not taking all
opportunities to help yourself out.

Firstly, and just to get it out of the way - this is *not* a C coding course.
Please review the unit outline, descriptions and discussions in lectures and workshops, and even:

  https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help2002?hl=why%20linux&a=48

for a correct understandiong of why we're here.

Now, near the top of this page, and in the left-hand margin of most webpages for this unit is an important link (in red) entitled:

  "Installing Linux on your laptop or desktop computer"

How far through that have you got?
Have you reached the section (search for it) that says:

  "We certainly don't wish to repeat that every time we want to run Linux on our Windows or macOS machines. So we need to save all of the 
changes/additions made, and then run the saved image in the future."

Reading that will address your problem of having downloading "docker/ubuntu like 3 times a week..." because it sounds like you are not capturing/saving 
your additions to the basic downloaded image to create your own image, with all your additions/changes saved.

There's no such expectation, but there is an expectation that you read what is presented to you.
This appears to be your first post to this forum so, if you haven't sought help, here, until now, have you been able to attend either face-to-face or 
online lab session to ask these same questions?

Hi,

I'm curious how to go about creating an alias in a docker container. Using bash 
profile or rc it works during the session I create the alias, however, successive uses 
of the container cause the system to seemingly remove the alias.

Anyone figured out any workarounds

My understanding is that Chris used a while(gets...) to iterate each line of the file, and for 
each line, Chris were trying to split it into parts(i.e the first part holding push or a 
possible arithmetic operation and the second part holing a integer value).

While "strcmp(word1, "push") == 0", then we know the current line starts with push, then we are 
gonna try to populate our stack integer array with whatever value that is and increase the SP.
(i.e. that's the block we are gonna fill).

And if there is only one word(word1) presents, that means we are gonna use the operands in our 
stack integer array to do some operation.(add, subtract, multiply...), then decease the SP to 
make sure everything is right.

If that helps.

The thing that I don't quite understand is that Chris returned "stack[SP--]", but I got the same 
answer as I return stack[SP]. It seems like "SP-- == SP" when SP == 0.

Yes, you're correct.
C11 requires that the compiler 'knows about' each identifier (such as a variable or function 
name) before it can be used.

So, you have two options:

- define f1 before you use it in f2,  or

- declare (announce) that f1 exists, even before you define it.
  For functions you can just say:

  void f1(char ch, int x);

  ... and later ...

  void f1(char ch, int x)
  {
     code implementing f1...
  }

  Note that the first (declaration) just ends in a semi-colon,
  while the second (definition) provides a block of code to implement f1.

There's a good reason for that.
The single statement:

  return stack[SP--];

is, of course, similar to:

  SP--;
  return stack[SP+1];

but the second case is bad practice, because you're accessing a stack item beyond/after the TOS, Once 
you've decremented SP (such as when you pop items) they should be considered 'no longer on the stack'.

You could add a global variables somewhere, or modify the code in any way you wish to build your solution.  
But remember that unnecessary global variables are a bad practice.

Try to find the spot in your code where such a new variable is needed, so that only the lines/statements 
actually requiring that new variable can see it.  And, because not every statement requires that new 
variable, it shouldn't be a global variable.

Once you've got a container running, you can use `docker exec` to execute programs inside the container. For example, running

> docker exec -it foobar bash

from any command window would start a new (bash) shell within "foobar" that you could use to interact with the container's environment.

Shell aliases are usually only one line long;
if we want a multi-line 'alias', we should use a shell function.

This is what I use to quickly create a new C file, and then to edit it with vi.

Just like a shell alias,  you'll need to place it in one of your shell start-up files,
such as in  .bashrc  or  .bash_profile


#
function vc {
if [ ! -r t.c ]
then
cat << END_END > t.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{

    return 0;
}
END_END
fi
vim +8 t.c

create a file where you put all the header files (include statements) and include that file. Including the main() in that file is not advisable, as your code will look strange and chances of mistake are higher.

Hi all, 
Just had a query regarding the implementation of the replace function in Lab 3. I know 
it is a challenge question but was trying to give it a go anyway. 

So with the replacement of the substring (such as in the examples given), how can the 
character array (after replacement) be a greater length than it was originally? It was 
my understanding you couldn't change the length of an array once it has been set. 

Also any general tips on how people have approached the question?

You are correct - it would be a problem if the string (array) holding the final result was too 
short to hold the result.  However, in this example, the prototype:

  void replace( char oldword[], char newword[], char whole_sentence[] );

it's the contents of whole_sentence[] that is being updated (in-situ), and holds the result.  
Thus, the code that calls replace() has the responsibility of passing sufficient space to hold the 
result.

A better function would also receive the known maximum length of whole_sentence[], as a 4th 
parameter, and ensure that this length was never exceeded  (and returning an error?).

In the more general case,  and we'll see examples of this in later lectures, the function would 
dynamically alloc *new* memory to hold the entire result, and return that newly allocated memory:

  char *replace_new( char oldword[], char newword[], char whole_sentence[] );

Good question.

Hi,

No;  the 1st project only covers/assesses materials from Weeks 1-4, from all those lectures, 
labs, and workshops.  The "answer" to the project, is not simply hidden in those teaching 
materials,  and you'll need to investigate some of the (covered) topics in greater depth.

The 1st project description is now COMPLETE and available, from:

  https://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/projects/project1.php

New section added:  "Main memory and cache memory"
Section reworded:   "Calling and returning from functions"

Nearly all previous problems have been corrected, and you should be able
to get a good understanding about what the project is addressing from
the currently available description.

You can access the the project's coolc website from:

  https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/coolc

You may upload your own cool program, or choose one of the test programs.
It will be compiled and, if valid syntax, a coolexe file will be generated
and may be downloaded.

(the shellscript to upload and compile your programs,
without using the web-interface, is still coming).

Good luck,

While experimenting with function calls, I have found that calling a function using a 
variable name as an argument works fine sometimes (e.g. it compiles and runs), but 
other times (seemingly at random), it causes compilation errors, e.g.  

"error: passing argument 1 of 'function_name' makes pointer from integer without a 
cast" 

(Screenshot below might explain this better)

I feel like I am missing something important here and would like to understand why 
this error is happening and what the correct methods to deploy in these instances 
would be?  (the code in the answer sheet is elegantly simple and skips this issue 
entirely, which is awesome, but doesn't satisfy my lack of understanding of why this 
error is presenting itself, if that makes sense?)

Hello Malcolm,

Happy to try to answer this, but I can't read the dark purple colour on your black 
background - the line in the yellow box.


BUT,  in the green box you're CORRECTLY passing (the address of) a character array to 
alpha_val(),  but in the red box you're INCORRECTLY passing a only single character.

Nothing to do with the function alpha_val() itself.

Wicked! weekend help is the BEST!  Thank you!

ok so why is the variable name "datacheck" in the green box considered an "address of", 
but then only a few lines down, the variable name "callval" in the red box considered 
differently, i.e. "only single character"?  

possibly a different (equally instructive) approach: what should i put in the red box to 
convince the "alpha_val" function do its thing on the value stored in the "callval" 
variable name?  (e.g. is there a way to rewrite the red box so it ---+-------------------
-------------(sorry cat attack!)?)  man this gets wordy in a hurry...  (thanks for your

Because you've defined datacheck[] as an array,  and not as a scalar variable.

Function alpha_val() expects and array as its parameter, so all is good.

In contrast, callval is a scalar variable, which is not what alpha_val() expects.

You can't.  You must pass an array to alpha_val().

You could define callval as an array, instead, and then:

    char callval[1];

    callval[0] = mystr_1[i];

    int returnval = alpha_val( callval );

but I may not understand what you're trying to do with alpha_val().

Whenever you have an array with just one element, rather than using a scalar variable, you 
sometimes need to rethink what you're doing.

I was reading through the Project 1 specifications and noticed that it is a 
requirement to have the source code written in C11 but then the compiling 
requirement/instruction says to use -std=c99 (opposed to -std=c11). I just wanted to 
know if this is a mistake or if it was deliberate. Thankyou.

 From the project's website:  https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/coolc
you'll see some small sample/test programs that you can view and compile.

Nothing there to really understand;  the link was just placed there for historic interest (now, 
so worded), for anyone interested in seeing that 16-bit computers really were 'a thing', not too 
long ago, to be replaced by 32-bit and now 64-bit computers.

Hello tutors,

This has been an excellent project so far, but I just wanted to clarify some things I ran into.

In the instruction set listing, it appears that the return opcode takes
up two AWORDs, is this right? Example programs show only one WORD being
used with no operand.

With printi, are we treating the popped value as an unsigned or signed
integer?

With prints, how is memory supposed to be read? Seeing as the memory-read
count is a statistic, I don't think simply passing a pointer from
main_memory to printf would suffice. Are we meant to duplicate the
string first?

Thanks.

A good and relevant question, at this stage, BUT not the sort of question to be asked and 
simply answered through this forum.

HOWEVER, it's exactly the sort of question to discuss with your project partner, explaining 
what you've already tried, what worked, and what didn't, and what you think the reasons to 
be.

It's a question whose answer can be found through simple experimentation, and one likely 
described in every reasonable textbook or online tutorial on C.


(and, unfortunately, asking the same question twice can't speed up the rate of replies)

Good luck,

No, I don't believe so.  Cache memory is part of the standard memory hierarchy of 
contemporary computer systems, introduced in Week-3.  If you've been keeping up with the 
lecture material, and also undertaking additional deeper reading from a recommended OS 
textbook,  then you'll already have the simple answers to your questions.

 From the schedule: 'Reviewing lecture material comprises about ⅓ of the effort required for 
this unit. The remainder of your time should be spent reading the recommended reading,..."

All the additional information from the Project description will provide is a clarification 
of what these terms mean in the context of the project.

the RETURN instruction does require 2 words - the 1st for the op-code, and the 2nd to indicate where 
the function's returned value should be copied.

A new section now added to the description - "Calling and returning from functions".

Signed.  All integers, expressions and variables, are signed (can be negative).

I still need to test this a bit more, but the string (in the Data Segment) is guaranteed to be null-
terminated, so it will be easy to print it.
However, this will be complicated once Cache Memory is being used (and described), so you'll want to 
think about it a bit more, then.

With prints is there supposed to be a null terminating byte in the coolexe program 
file as if the string eg: "abcdef" is even length no null byte is present. 

There seems to be an issue with the word following the return value. In the 
parameters.cool test file the return statement for main indicates that the TOS should 
be copied into FP+3 however this isn't in memory. Also for the add function the return 
indicates that TOS should be copied into FP+1 however the function requires two 
arguments.

Hmm, I'm having some trouble comprehending the purpose of the operand word.

Writing to the TOS works fine, even with particularly long function call
chains, but it's not compliant to the instruction set, whereas considering
the return offset with respect to the FP doesn't line up with there the
coolexes expect the return value to be.  Neither the functions section
in the description or the instruction set listing actually describe the
purpose of the operand; only the disassembler on the runcool page does,
which I'm not sure I have understood correctly.

All I can gather is that the size of the locals of a given function
affect the return offset, similar to a callee-cleanup calling convention
in other instruction sets.

Good question.
The correct way to think about this is to NOT focus on the implementation details, but to 
focus on the meaning of what you're trying to do.

Firstly, C considers a non-zero value as a true value and, thus, a zero value is considered 
false.  Further, while the <stdbool.h> header file does define true to have the lexical value 
of 1, you could (theoretically and legally) define its value:

  #include <stdbool.h>

  ....
  #undef  true
  #define true  3
  ....

Though legal C, it would surely break many existing programs!

So do not focus on the implemented values of true being 1 and false being 0.
Instead focus on just using the type 'bool' and the constants 'true' and 'false' :

  bool afact   = true;
  bool untrue  = false;
  bool nottrue = ! true;

THEN, as in other programming languages, it's best to NOT even use the constants 'true' and 
'false' in conditional expressions.  DO NOT say:

  if( today_is_tuesday == true ) {
     ....
  }

Instead, carefully choose your variable names so that they are clearly Boolean values, and 
just say:

   if( today_is_tuesday ) {
      ....
   }

HI, I am attempting the Luhn problem, and i am finding that when a full "card number" (16 digits) is entered as an argument, the string stored is no longer correct. this happens for any length of str of int over 10. 

eg. ./luhn 1234567890, the string stored is 1234567890 
but when i enter 
./luhn 12345678909, the string stored is -539222979.

What is happening that i am not understanding or don't know about?

I'm wondering if you're trying to store the value as an integer, rather than as a string?

A 32-bit signed integer is able to store integers in the range -2147483648 to 2147483647,
and larger values will overflow that range.  See:

#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    printf("%i\n", 1234567890);
    printf("%i\n", 12345678909);
    return 0;
}


This lab exercise is better approached by dealing with the credit-card numbers as strings, not integers.

The returned value needs to be copied to the first location of the current stack frame, so that it will be 
the (new) TOS of the caller's stack frame.

If the current function has no parameters, that location will be FP+1 (the saved return address),
if the current function has one parameter, that location will be FP+2
if the current function has two parameters, that location will be FP+3, .....

The number of a function's local variables has no effect on where the current FP is, only the number of 
parameters.

Can I copy the return value of a function to the saved return address no matter how many parameters the function has? 
Because the parameters of a function being called could be considered as the local variables of the calling function. 
Then can I simply assume the returned value is on TOS od the caller's stack frame in this way?

Not sure if I make me clear, I mean the caller's stack frame and current stack Fram is kind of overlapped?

Sorry for the endless questions. 

How do we determine the number of parameters to a function?

It seems like the term following return should be equal to the number of parameters, however in 
functions such as parameters.cool the value after the return for main suggest that main has 2
parameters even though it's only parameter is void. 

I have some code that tracks the number of parameters using in the function and store this in 
main_memory however this doesn't seem to be an intended way of working out how many parameters are 
using in a function.

No.  The returned value needs to be on the TOS of the caller's stack frame (it will be a new entry on that frame).
You cannot leave it in the callee's stack frame, as you must remove/pop the callee's parameters before returning, and they 
appear before the returned-address.

No, they cannot.
They may be detailed arithmetic expressions (now calculated) that have never been located in any variable.

They are good questions, and hopefully slower-starters will actually read and understand them, rather than 
asking them again!


> How do we determine the number of parameters to a function?

YOU don't;  that's the coolc compiler's job, to emit correct code based on the source program.
The role of your runcool program/project is simply to execute those instructions, assuming that they are 
correct.  All details about the original source code have been 'thrown away' and do not appear in the 
coolexe file.

With IWORD and AWORD types defined in the starting code, it is my understanding that 
AWORD would be used for holding addresses and IWORD would hold any integers. Is this a 
correct interpretation?

Further, in the already defined write_memory, it requires AWORD inputs for both the 
address and the value. Shouldn't the value be IWORD as it requires signed integers in 
main memory? Additionally, the read_memory function returns AWORD, where IWORD 
probably makes more sense (as signed integers are only supported in main memory). 

Hopefully this makes sense,
Thanks

My partner and I for the assignment were trying to understand exactly what is being 
asked of us for this project and came up with a few queries:

- What exactly is reading memory and writing memory. Does writing to memory mean 
pushing something onto the stack?

- When you add something to the stack does it go on the top (high address) or bottom 
(low address). This is in reference to the diagram in the project brief in the Calling 
and returning from functions section.

- In terms of what code we actually write, are we coding the instructions such as 
halt, nop, add, etc.

Thank you very much for any assistance.

Good for asking, but there appears to be some fundamental confusion here.
Wondering if you've been able to get along to a lab session, and/or last Friday's workshop?

 
> - What exactly is reading memory and writing memory. Does writing to memory mean 
> pushing something onto the stack?

The memory is used to store instructions, your global data/variables, function parameters and 
local variables (which reside on the stack when they're in use), and temporary values when 
evaluating arithmetic instructions (also on the stack).  Instructions can't be changed, they are 
read-only, but all other items can both be read and written.

The diagram in the project description is correct.  While we (logically) push items to the top-
of-the-stack (TOS), new items are added (physically) to decreasing memory addresses, as the stack
grows downwards.  Suggest that you review last Friday's workshop.
 
> - In terms of what code we actually write, are we coding the instructions such as 
> halt, nop, add, etc.

Your project is performing the role of the CPU, reading and writing items from the memory, 
interpreting the instructions from memory which, in turn, result in more reads+writes of memory 
until we reach a HALT instruction.  You'll see this provided for you in the function

  int execute_stackmachine(void)

in runcool.c
The HALT instruction is already implemented for you!

Hope this helps.

Hi,


My partner and I are having trouble with how we should split the work load. For past 
programming group projects there were clear methods/functions that made sense to split 
between each other, making it easier for both people (still communicating and adding 
input to each other's codes). However, for this project it is recommended that we 
don't do this (split functions then just "glue" combined effort at the end).

Writing code is only a part (smaller part) of the project. There is a lot to discuss and plan, and you will see that you will get a clear idea about how to split the coding at that stage.

Hi Chris, I was perusing over the starting code for the project and noticed that in 
the execute_stackmachine function, SP is initialised to N_MAIN_MEMORY_WORDS (65536) 
which is then used as the index to access the memory value at that address. However, 
since arrays start at 0, it would appear that could result in undefined behaviour as 
the highest address we should only access in main_memory would be 65535.

Just as clarification, I'm assuming the stack functionality that can be implemented is 
not important in that the 2 alternatives which is either incrementing the SP before 
pushing (which means decrementing the SP after popping) or incrementing the SP after 
pushing (so decrementing the SP before popping) are both valid.

To avoid the potential undefined default behaviour with accessing the value at the 
(non-existent) address of 65536, shouldn't SP be initialised to N_MAIN_MEMORY_WORDS-1?

But wouldn't the very first thing you'd ever do is to push something onto the stack, not to use 
the TOS immediately?  Have a look at the first code that ever runs - in the boot-segment.

Does this suggest that the stack implementation that is intended is to increment the SP prior to 
pushing elements onto the stack (and decrement the SP after popping elements off)?
Otherwise it may appear that during the boot-segment, it is pushing 0 into address 65536 which could 
constitute undefined behaviour.

But we push things on to the stack by *decrementing* the SP - stack grows downwards.
You modify SP before modifying the stack.

If I were to add some bits to check for the status of each data in the cache (eg if it's 
clean or dirty), would those bits be included in the total storage of the cache (2^5)?

eg cache is 32-word, but 2 of those are used to store these bits and not used to store 
data from RAM.

Or would these not count towards the memory capacity of the cache? For RAM the memory 
addresses do not count towards its storage capacity (2^16), so I'm not sure if I need to 
include these additional bits in the storage of the cache.

Thanks.

No, not included.
They are an overhead, necessary to design/implement the cache itself - 'housekeeping'.

Thank you for adding the cache memory section.

As I understand it, the writing policy is specified, but there's no mention of what happens if the cache memory is full, or which cache words would first get evicted.
This is something I'm concerned about as cache hits and misses are a part of the marking.
What exactly is the cache replacement policy would you want for us to implement? Given the choice, I would implement LRU, but I wanted input from the tutors first.

Hello,

There is no need for a specific cache replacement policy.
Each location from main memory has only one possible location in cache memory where it can be mirrored (always the same location), and each location in cache memory remembers 
which location from main memory that it is caching.

Policies like LRU are good for (software) components, such as file-systems, that can afford the time to choose (or predict) the 'best' items to evict, but as cache memory may 
have to perform these replacements several billion times per second, it's all about a simple direct-mapping policy.

Yes, that's the intent.
Both data types have the same (physical) size, and so the contents of either type may be 
copied/stored in the other.  The only difference you may see is based on how you interpret/use 
those values.

However, as you'll only ever need to use addresses to index main memory - and they are always 
non-negative - you should see no problems with invalid array indices.

I suggest that you experiment with this a bit, and see whether it actually matters.
Memory can hold both addresses and integers, so there can be no single correct function to read 
or write the correct value  (could have 2 otherwise identical functions I suppose).

In hindsight, the parameter to function read_memory() should have been of type AWORD, but it 
won't matter (and I don't want to confuse people with unnecessary changes).

Not sure if I'm understanding this wrong, but a loader would need to first copy the 
instruction (.coolexe) from secondary memory into the RAM, right? And then those 
instructions (and associated data) are copied to cache, then processed by CPU.

Assuming that's the case, AWORD is an unsigned int so it can't store negative 
numbers. For the parameters.coolexe example there were -1 values. 

So is the main_memory[] supposed to be where these instructions are first stored? I 
might be misunderstanding something.

This code will show you that an AWORD *can* store a negative value, without conversion.
It's all about how the contents of the variable's memory is used in a context:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
#define AWORD               uint16_t

    int minus1  = -1;
    printf("%i\n", minus1);

    AWORD addr = (-1);
    printf("%i\n", addr);

    addr += 2;
    printf("%i\n", addr);

    return 0;
}

 
> So is the main_memory[] supposed to be where these instructions are first stored? I

Yes;  from the runcool.c starting file:

   //  READ THE PROVIDED coolexe FILE INTO main_memory[]
   void read_coolexe_file(char filename[])
   {

Hello,

I am a bit confused in reagard to the collexe file.

I'm trying to put the 16-bitkeywords into the memory array, however every time it just 
fills the array with 0.

Yet if I try with the non exe file (.cool), it reads the file correctly (using the fgets())

Basically what is the contents of the .coolexe file? Is it integers?

Yet if I go and to atoi() why do I still get 0 for every thing?

Thank you for the help.

fgets() is a great function for reading lines of text from files.
It is not used for reading arbitrary bytes of data, some of which may be zero-bytes (NULL-bytes) which 
have a special meaning when dealing with strings.

Suggest that you review Lecture.8

Sorry but I still don't quite understand,

The result printed was the same I got when I attempted to store -1 in AWORD, it printed 
65535 (which became 1 when 2 was added in the next line). That's within the 0-65535 range.

If we have to return a negative number, say, from operations that only subtracted numbers, 
how would that negative number be returned? Although AWORD can perform addition as if 65535 
etc were negative numbers, what would happen in the context where a negative number is the 
answer to be returned?

maybe this will help try:

IWORD signed    = unsigned;

print and compare the values, you could also check the hex values aswell

Hello,

in the starting code runner.c
the read and write memory functions are defined in this way
```
AWORD read_memory(int address)
{
    return main_memory[address];
}

void write_memory(AWORD address, AWORD value)
{
    main_memory[address] = value;
}
```

why the `address` in read_memory is of type int while in write_memory it is of type 
AWORD?

if all addresses are always between 0 and 2^16-1 then it does make sense to make 
address type as AWORD in read_memory, can I change the signature of the function for 
that?

And also can I change the types of these 3 variables?

```
//  THE 3 ON-CPU CONTROL REGISTERS:
    int PC      = 0;                    // 1st instruction is at address=0
    int SP      = N_MAIN_MEMORY_WORDS;  // initialised to top-of-stack
    int FP      = 0;                    // frame pointer
```
from int to AWORD since it is guaranteed they will operate between 0 and 2^16-1?

I think it is still difficult to find partners only through Help2002. It is difficult and 
unfair for online students to find partners only through Help2002. I think the professor can 
find the students who want to find partner through email and help them to assign. Because I 
need to find partner now, but it is very difficult. Although help2002 is also difficult. This 
is my personal idea and I hope you can adopt it. Thank you.

There are multiple discord groups and WhatsApp groups where students usually talk. help2002 is the

for partners as well.
here is the discord group for CITS 2021 students https://discord.gg/P7fgbU5qqw
and here is the discord group for all CS/DS students https://discord.gg/uPVjXWvTnX
and you can find WhatsApp groups through the UWA phone apps in the community section.
Just be careful, official help and guaranteed "correct" answers will be always through help2002. 
these groups are only my auxiliary tools as an online student but these are not replacements for

it seems that you cant set the default value of a variable as another variable. you first need to

No, that would be far too strict a restriction.

As you can see from the language's syntax  (I appreciate that it may be a new concept to you):

  https://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/projects/coolsyntax.php

local (and global) variables, can only be initialised to an integer constant - but not to an arbitrary 
expression:

  int IDENT [ "=" intconst ] ";"

(I may change this, but it's not critical for the project).

> And also can I change the types of these 3 variables?

Change them if you wish, but note that the change will have no effect on the execution of your 
program  (and will not affect the visual marking of your code).
The change will only be 'cosmetic', but if that helps you understand your code better, then 
it's a good idea.

Keep in mind that there's no perfect solution.  What, for example, should be the type of each 
element of main_memory[], given that the array is used to hold both addresses and integers 
(and, when storing strings, single characters, too)?

Also, as discussed in an earlier thread, your plan will not work for SP, as it needs to be 
initialised beyond the stack so that it can always point at the TOS.

Then you have somehow changed, and broken it, or are compiling it incorrectly.

Hi I wouldn't mind partnering up, I've got experience programming in C in the past :) 
I'm also fine to work at uni.

As you will have noticed, I've sent an email, via LMS, to all students in the unit reminding them that 
they can work in teams, and can use help2002 to express an interest in finding a project partner.

I do not believe that there is any unfairness in giving students the option to work in teams, and the 
opportunity to find their own project partners.  In recent years, about 40% of students have worked 
alone on CITS2002 projects, for a variety of reasons.  I suggest that you consider the other side of 
the situation - if you wished to work alone on the project, would you want to be forced to work with 
someone else?  Moreover, I don't think it's the role of educators to find (compatible) project 
partners for students unable to find their own project partners.  There is ample opportunity for you 
to reach out to other students, through online labs, the additional Saturday online review lecture, 
and this forum.

Good luck,

Hello Chris,

We have found a bug inside the compiler, which is demonstrated through the following 
code (note this does compile):

void toto(void){
}

int main(void){
    toto();
}

If you look at the assembly code, on line 5 of the exe, there is the call opcode. 
However, this call provides the address 5, which is the address of the call itself. 
This results in coolexe looping indefinitely, as the call will call itself.

Looks like you're mis-interpreting which instructions have a following word, hitting a 5

Hello Chris,

I have tried my runcool result with all test files.
but my code report lower values for "@number-of-main-memory-reads" sometimes (0-10% 
lower) but all the other statistics are the same (including the optional "non-
required" ones)
And I'm getting correct results "7 factorial is 5040","Ackermann(3, 10) is 8189" etc.

will my code be penalized if it reported values lower than the sample solution output? 
(assuming there is no error in how @number-of-main-memory-reads is calculated)

To confirm:

When popping values from the stack, if a value is cached then it can simply be 
retrieved from cache. If however, the value is not currently cached, it must be 
fetched from memory. 

My question:

When a value is popped from the stack, it is no longer in memory. So do we need to 
write uncached values to the cache before popping them? Or can we simply return the 
required value, and ignore the cache?

Hi!

In regards to the return function, the instructions webpage says it is a 2-word 
instruction and that:

> "The integer value on the TOS is the function's returned value."

I am confused to whether this is saying that the word following the return function 
should be pushed on the top of the stack, or whether the value to be returned will 
already be on top of the stack (as a result of previous instructions).

I am assuming it is the former but just wanted to check.

Thanks!

Looking at the read/write statistics of the test programs I was wondering whether the 
loading of instructions into main memory count as a write? Once I discounted the 
instruction loading from the statistics (by directly accessing main memory) my 
statistics matched. Is this correct?

As a follow up question, do the instructions get loaded into the cache from the file? 
I assume not, assuming that the instructions/stack information only get loaded into 
cache once accessed. Or does the cache only contain stack information?

Hi,
Just a quick question about the sample outputs regarding "prints"

if I compile a simple cool program like:

int mian(void)
{
    print "abcdef";
}

The sample solution didn't show the statistics for the "number of main memory reads". Is it 
supposed to be so? Am I misunderstanding anything? Because the the number of instructions 
is still 5? We at least read some instructions into main memory, right? 

Thanks in advance.

Hi,

Impressive stuff (assuming we both have those extra stats counting correctly.
I suggest that you just use your text-editor to search for possible places where you're 
accessing main_memory[] directly, without counting the accesses.


> will my code be penalized if it reported values lower than the sample solution output? 
> (assuming there is no error in how @number-of-main-memory-reads is calculated)

Yes; as discussed in Friday's workshop, there's no real way to bypass memory accesses, unless 
you're 'cheating' by accessing the main_memory[] array, directly, rather than through the 
provided 'bottleneck' functions to read and write from the array.

(unless your data is magically teleporting from RAM to CPU :-)

The value to be returned is already on the TOS;
the word following the I_RETURN instruction is a frame-pointer offset, indicating where the 
returned value has to go.

You can't, and don't need to distinguish between them.

No.  Our statistics only start accumulating once we start executing the program.

The cache only 'fills' up with data from both RAM and the CPU, not from our .coolexe file 
which would be read from disk:

Don't quite understand your wording,
but why can't you use the value in the PC register to indicate which memory location you want?

No need to wonder - the computer in front of you is an experimental tool that's almost impossible to break.

Received: from 10.4.0.14
X-smilie: none
X-img: none

Hello Chris,

I think I figured out why my code report had lower values in the memory read.

In the JEQ instruction, there are two possible memory reads.
A - popping the TOS to get the boolean value
B - reading the next word to get the address to jump to

I think what the sample solution does is it does A and B steps so in total it will always do B 
memory reads

but in my case, I only do the B step iff the boolean value of A is 0. If not I just ignore the 
next word without reading it by incrementing PC++

so if the boolean value is not equal to zero, i just don't read the memory for the next address 
since it will not be useful and I just skip the word via PC++


When I started reading the jump address even when I don't need to, I get a matching result of the 
sample solution.

May I ask if my original method is valid (doing step B only if needed)? I think it is fine and a 
reasonable non-hacky optimization.

Please let me know your thoughts

Yes, and yes.

Data flows from RAM (incl. the stack) to CPU, through the cache.
The cache has no idea what the data was requested for, or which part (role) of the RAM it 
came from.

Yeah... I think YOU have a point there.
I got the same problem initially when I test files "if.coolexe", "if else.coolexe" and "while.coolexe".
I got 17,  instead of 18 shown on the sample output.
Because I thought I only need to read the "address to jump" if the TOS value is 0.

Got the other non-required statistics right, but don't quite understand what is the maximum depth of function 
call :(

Can confirm this is the case for me as well. My statistics for `ackermann-deep.coolexe` were:
```
Ackermann(3, 10) is 8189
result = 0
@number-of-main-memory-reads    1273898201
@number-of-main-memory-writes   424630003
@number-of-cache-memory-hits    0
@number-of-cache-memory-misses  0
```
Which is 1318596525-1273898201 = 44698324 less reads than the value from the testcase
Making the JMP read from memory always regardless if a jump is successful or not made the reads count 
equal to the testcase.
And to confirm, I am only modifying the read count within the read_memory() function.

here all you got to do is keep track of the depth a function is in and take the max value. the depth value 
increases when you call a function but it decreases when you exit the function(aka return). so if you ran 
3 functions inside each other, the max depth is 3 and the number of calls is 3. but if you 3 functions 
inside each other twice, the max depth is still 3 but the number of calls is 6 now. Hopes this helps : )

yeah i got the same result here as well when i skip the read instruction if the boolean value is not equal 
to zero
Ackermann(3, 10) is 8189
@number-of-main-memory-reads    1273898201

@number-of-cache-memory-hits    0
@number-of-cache-memory-misses  0



I'm happy to use the method in the sample solution by reading the 2 words every time in the JEQ 
instruction so I don't lose marks, but I will see what Chris see fit and go from there.

Thanks for that - a better solution, and great detective work!

The sample solution has been modified to report both possible memory-read statistics, and we'll be looking 
for either of these values when marking your projects.

Hello Chris,

I know this might be clear in the project instructions. But I just want to make sure that 
I got the idea correctly.

does the original memory address get stored inside the cache? or will it be considered a 
housekeeping task and the memory address is stored in another array?

because if the addresses are included it will make the total cache locations 16 instead of 
32.

and if we are storing the addresses inside the cache location, there is a way to store the 
main memory addresses in a shorter format (less than 16bits) so you can technically store 
the dirtiness of a cache location inside the cache and the total cache locations would 
still be 16.

please let me know your thoughts if main memory addresses should be stored inside the 
cache or in a separate array like the dirtiness task.

The cache has 32 words of cached words from the main_memory.
Any housekeeping information is in addition to those 32 words.

Please read a chapter from a good OS or computer architecture textbook, or online tutorial, about 
caches (and don't immediately think of them as something in need of a software solution).

No-one has suggested keeping the 'dirty' information in a separate array.

Hello Chris,

When I return an int in main, it looks like the sample solution displays the exit 
status as one byte, despite the fact main memory consists of 16 bits (two bytes)

For example, running this code:

int main(void) {
	int c = 1;
	int d = 4;
	int e =  0;
	e = c - d;
	return e;
}

gives an exit status of 253 which is -3 when interpreting as 8 bits signed. However, 
as all values should be 16 bits, shouldn't the exit status display 65533?

Thank you for your time.

In the documentation the popr command is described as:

"pop relative
the word immediately following the 'popr' instruction provides the offset to be added to 
the FP to provide the address into which the value on the TOS should be popped"

once the offset has been fetched and added to the FP, is this location the address into 
which the TOS should be popped too, or is this the location of the address to use when 
popping too from the TOS?

 From the wording I think it is the former, however I'm not entirely sure.

e.g. write to FP + 3  OR write to memory location referenced in FP + 3

I hope my question is clear.

Hi,

A good observation.
When a Linux process calls the exit() system-call, it passes it an integer exit status (typically 32-bits on your laptop).  
The kernel interprets 16-bits of this integer as a combination of 3 smaller integers:

  - 8-bits to provide what we imagine is the real/useful return code (such as 0, 1, ...)
  - 7-bits to indicate *why* the process terminated (such as with a Segmentation Violation),
  - 1-bit indicating if a copy of the process's memory image was written to disk (a core dump).

Normally we just call exit() with a small integer, so 'all' of that integer is interpreted as the 8-bit return code,
and all the other bits are zero.

If you call exit() with a value greater than 255, then some bits beyond 8 bits will have an additional meaning to
anyone/anycode examining the full exit status.


The programming interface for all this is declared (on Linux) in

      /usr/include/sys/wait.h
and   /usr/include/bits/waitstatus.h

(in /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/sys/wait.h

Our 1st project's website: https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/coolc
has been updated, and the sample solution (which run's 'behind' that website) has been updated 
to implement the write-back cache.

The sample solution has been written in a style hopefully easy for you to understand (when it's 
released), and implements a literal interpretation of a write-back cache, as you should read 
about in a good OS textbook.  There may be some small optimisations possible, resulting in 
different statistics being reported but, remember, that the hardware implementation of a cache 
can't perform its 'magic' as succinctly as a software implementation can.  So keep it basic!

The concept of the write-back cache is not difficult, for those that have visited a textbook.  
However, a simple 'clean' implementation can be a challenge, and a single incorrect line of 
code can 'break everything' - your cool programs can still be interpreted, but will produce 
wrong results because the instruction sequence that they are executing is incorrect because 
your memory references are incorrect.  Fun and frustrating at the same time!  When you get it 
right, it just all falls out beautifully.

Once you have a version of your project working without caching, keep a copy of that as your 
reference version.  Then, while implementing your cache, compare the outputs of the two 
versions,  and check them against the sample solution.

Good luck,

Yes, it's the former.
The popr instruction is used for updating a function's parameters and local variables, both of 
which exist on the stack while the function is executing  (either side, +ve and -ve, of the FP).

Hi!

In the template code, main_memory is declared with type AWORD.

This means that -1 is converted to 65,535 when it is added to the array.

Can we change the type of main_memory to integer to allow both AWORD's and IWORD's to 
be stored properly? Or do we need to figure out some other workaround?

No it doesn't.  They are not converted, and you are only 'seeing' any conversion when you 
ascribe a meaning to the 16-bit quantities.

No, no changes.
That would entirely change the nature of the project, and ignore the fact that we're 
representing a 16-bit machine capable of storing addresses and data in the same pyhiscal 
spaces.  Would your proposed integers be 32-bits wide, 64-bits, or maybe just/still 16-bits,  
each dependent on where your program was compiled and run?

Please stick with the project specs, and keep reading about what's happening if unsure.

The syntax error detection is not great, but you have to try to send it valid cool programs, 
not C programs.  Look at the many provided example programs, or the cool syntax page.
You want:

    print "a";

Found a solution. Problem seems to be you cant create a text file, write in it and 
then save it as .cool , you have to directly create the .cool file with VIM and write 
in it through that.

Happy to find the solution with you, but that's not it.

The website doesn't care where the plain-text source file came from; doesn't have to be from 
vim.  But be careful if you're using a tool like Word or similar to create (any) textfile, as 
it treats quotes and double quotes very differently to what most programming languages and 
programmers expect.

It looks like you've recently modified your .bashrc or .bash_profile file, to add a new 
line(s) commencing with 'Export'.

However, case is significant to bash, and there is no known command named Export.
The correct command is  'export', all lowercase.

Hi,

Originally your sample solution did not had cache which helped with debugging before 
our own implementation of cache (which seems to be the last step). Was curious if you 
could additionally have a statistic output of the reads and write (with no cache 
implementation), as it was before.

Trying to reach deep into my own memory remembering those outputs myself but obviously

Hmmm, a reasonable request, but it'll require a little thinking as to how to combine the two in 
the same solution.  Hmmmm, maybe run each program twice, once with and once without.  Will give

(Politely, but a rather frustratingly) if there was a mid-semester test, where do you think 
it would be announced,  or where and why would it have been 'hidden' such that you would 
have missed the information?  How are you even aware of the 2 projects and final exam?

As above, it's probably the text file named .bashrc or .bash_profile in your home 
directory.

While the error message is indicating a problem, it's likely just something that your 
interactive shell is 'missing out on',  rather than anything that will do any harm as 
you work.

From: poster057@student.uwa.edu.au
Received: from 10.20.159.200
X-smilie: none
X-img: none

Hi,

I was wondering about how X Macros would be judged in terms of readability and presentation.

X Macros are basically a convenient means of defining a list of values
and relationships that must be used in slightly modified form in several
different places through the use of the preprocessor. They operate by
taking advantage of the ability to define and undefine the same macro
at different points in the program.
See the Wikipedia article here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Macro

For example, the instructions (as a relationship between pairs of id
and string name) could be defined in an X Macro at the beginning of the
file, and then this definition could be used to generate at compile time
the enum of instructions, the string array, and a switch statement for
instruction decoding. This could be done without having to duplicate
definitions of the actual data required, which could be easier to
understand and maintain as per the "don't repeat yourself" principle.

On the other hand, people unfamiliar with them may find them difficult
to read and understand due to their nature as complex multi-levelled
macros with redefinitions at every invocation site.

As such, for the purposes of this unit, would implementing X Macros in
the project be something that would improve readability and presentation,
or negatively impact it?

Thanks in advance.

I noticed with the sample solution the number of main memory writes was equal or 
higher with the cache when compared to the version without a cache. 

The program seems to work out the number of memory read of fast jeq relative to slow 
jeq based on the number of jeq instructions that don't jump. With the cache this can 
result in negative number of reads.

I have been able to exactly match the performance of the sample solution cache with 64 
words of cache. Is there any way to store 32 values into the 32 word cache.

Probably a question that is more relevant for a textbook. However, the behaviour of the sample 
solution matches mine when i am able to store 32 values and the 32 addresses that goes with 
them in memory. 


program \/  (has conditional if statements entirely in cache)
int main(void){ 
    int n = 1000; 
    while(n){ 
        int a = 0; 
 	n = n-1; 
   	}

No, my question was based on you sounding like you didn't know/understand how to place 32 items in a 
32 item cache.
Perhaps just the wording.

Thanks;  I'll fix the sample's reporting.
It's just the challenge of reporting everything, to everyone who wants it.
It's akin to telling your cache that you may or not wish to count something simply
because it's coming from a JEQ instruction.

The very reason that (only) 32-bytes were chosen is so that most programs will exceed it, and force 
multiple memory locations to have to share cache locations.

It's a technique that I use very frequently, but I've not known it by the name X Macros before.
I often use it when writing parsers,  probably following the abuse-the-preprocessor approach of lex 
and yacc.  The specification of Linux system calls is another place that they're seen, and things 
like in-kernel cbufs.

In some cases it can make things more readable, because much of the 'infrastructure' is hidden,  but 
it requires you to be aware of everything at the beginning, or know how your code may involve. and 
while getting it right, the first time, it can be difficult to debug.

I don't think it'd hold much benefit for this project, simply because we have so few instructions, 
with not much similarity between them (other than the arith. ones).

I'm not sure how/why the technique relates to this unit, specifically,  and using it won't improve 
any marks for the project, given that full marks can be attained using the basic/obvious approach.

I've been doing some research on how to implement the cache for the project, and I'm a 
bit stumped in regards to what to do with a full cache.

I understand that one of the words needs to be evicted from the cache (after being 
written back to main memory if required, of course).

However, in my research I've encountered a number of possible ways that this is 
implemented in different caches. ( For example: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies )

I was just wondering if you are allowed to tell us if there is any specific 
replacement policy we should use (as I'm assuming it will affect the results for hits 
and misses), or is that something we just need to figure out ourselves with trial and 
error?

Thankyou looks like it is working now. 

With the cache the sample solution is able to run the while loop of the following 
function entirely in cache. This requires the cache to store at least 31 values and 
the 31 associated address requiring more than 32 words of cache memory. I thought 
that we need to store all of the address and housekeeping data in the 32 word 
cache. 

int main(void){
    int c = 0;
    int d = 0; 
    int e = 0;
    int f = 0;
    e = c + d + e;
    int n = 1000;
    while(n){
        int a = 0;
        int b = 0;
        int aa = 0;
        n = n-1;
    }
    return 0;
}
(the int c, d, e, f and the sum is important for the TOS and the program 
instruction to not overlap in the cache)

No, 32 words of content, plus whatever additional storage you need for the housekeeping 
(unspecified as to how).

Hello Chris,

I have implemented my cache and it seems to work but it has slightly higher memory 
reads but half of the memory writes compared to the output solution and I'm struggling 
to find out why.

When I focused on the reported stats I saw that in the sample solution "@number-of-
main-memory-reads" in the non-cache output is always equal to ("@number-of-main-
memory-reads" + "number-of-cache-memory-hits") in the cache output. Which suggest that 
it might be that only the read_memory function increment the cache hit stats.

is this the expected behaviour?

because when I read in the textbooks that a cache write can also produce a hit.

Thanks for the post;  different textbooks certainly define what a cache hit is, i.e. when it 
gets counted.  Some will split their definition into two - read-hits, and write-hits.

In most programming we see that reads from memory occur 5-10x more frequently than writes,  
it's usually only the read-hits that people focus on when measuring/comparing performance of 
hardware, or even the implementation of algorithms.

Your observation is not incorrect,  but for this project we've just defined cache-hits to be 
the read-hits.  Including the write-hits *would* be simple, just counting at the correct time.

However, as we've set the project, and because a number of students appear very close to 
finishing their projects (aiming to match the sample solution),  I'm not willing to change it 
now.

Hope that makes sense. ??

 From my perspective:

@number-of-main-memory-reads is the number CPU need to directly fetch data from 
memory (not the cache). In the code, it's the number of "return 
main_memory[address]" called.

@number-of-main-memory-writes is the number CPU need to directly write data to 
memory (not the cache), and due to the write-back policy, it should be the number of 
write-back times. In the code, it's the number of "main_memory[address] = value" 
called.

Am I right?

My runcool is right for all sample solutions without cache. But when using cache, 
the statistics have problems. For basic exmaple :
My output is:
@number-of-main-memory-reads-(fast-jeq) 7
@number-of-main-memory-writes   0
@number-of-cache-memory-hits    4
@number-of-cache-memory-misses  7

But the sample output is:
@number-of-main-memory-reads                  7
@number-of-main-memory-reads-(fast-jeq)       7
@number-of-main-memory-writes                 11
@number-of-cache-memory-hits                  4
@number-of-cache-memory-misses                7

I tracked the simulation step by step, all the writes occurred in cache, and there 
was no need to write back. So why the @number-of-main-memory-writes is 11 in sample 
solution?

What's wrong with my understanding?

Need help. Thanks a lot.

Hi Zexuan,

Did you get the shared files sorted? Basically, you need to type the option -v when running 
dockers, i.e.

docker run --rm -it -v /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/FOLDER:/home/Labs -w /home/Labs --name ubuntu 
ubuntu:latest bash

It's not immediately clear, from your wording, how you've implemented the 'flow' on 
information, in both directions, between CPU, cache, and RAM.
Do you mean 'there is no cache', or 'fetching from RAM, but not the cache'?
For example, with a cache, the CPU does not directly access main_memory[].

You'll need to consider your ideas from/using multiple test programs.

Do you *initialise* your cache, if so with what values.
Are your cache elements initially dirty (write them back, where),
or not dirty (do they magically have the correct values already?)

Do you consistently account for the fact that the reads and writes via/through cache can 
come in any order?

Just a reminder, while your focus is mostly on your 1st project, of tomorrow's workshop.

This is the first of several (the remaining) workshops where we look at a 
topics/questions from past exam papers and, thus, provides a good opportunity to see 
what has been asked on recent past papers, ask *why* a question was asked and, of 
course, to attempt it yourself before the workshop.

A good opportunity, now, rather than cramming it all in, in the last few days before the 
exam!  Good luck,

Hello Chris,

I have tried my best to figure out why my solution has lower memory reads/writes when I implemented the cache over the past 
3 days but couldn't find why. I believe my method of implementing the cache is correct since I followed the steps from a 
textbook provided in the unit OS textbook section.

Here I avoided using the fast-jeq implementation since I want to reach the same result as the sample solution.

these are the output stats for the sample solution vs mine for ackermann-deep.coolexe:

name                                          solution      my_solution   diff

@number-of-main-memory-reads                  350857547     349460717     -0.40%
@number-of-main-memory-reads-(fast-jeq)       339675300     IGNORED       +0.00%
@number-of-main-memory-writes                 424630025     249969062     -41.1%
@number-of-cache-memory-hits                  967738978     969135808     +0.14%
@number-of-cache-memory-misses                350857547     349460717     -0.40%

@number-of-instructions-(not-required)        446983257     446983257     +0.00%
@number-of-function-calls-(not-required)      44698326      44698326      +0.00%
@maximum-function-call-depth-(not-required)   8192          8192          +0.00%
@maximum-stack-depth-(not-required)           40956         40956         +0.00%
@percentage-of-cache-hits-(not-required)      73.4%         73.5%         +0.14%



My solution provides the exact stats without cache but lower stats with cache, and as you can see it has the same number of 
instructions, calls, max func depth, stack depth which suggests it is highly likely that it follows the same behaviour and 
the same instruction path as the sample solution.

the counters are in the correct placement and I separated the cache read/write functions from the main memory read/write 
functions and used them in the "read_memory"/"write_memory" functions so the counters are calculated in the correct place 
regardless of where "read_memory"/"write_memory" are used in.

the property of (with cache :"@number-of-main-memory-reads" + "@number-of-cache-memory-hits") = (without cache: "@number-
of-main-memory-reads") still holds true in my case
349460717 + 969135808 = 1318596525
and for the sample solution
350857547 + 967738978 = 1318596525

So my solution does the same number of reads as the sample solution.

May I ask if there is a possibility to consider solutions that provide lower stats output as still valid in the automated 
marking?

I have the same problem like you.

My output for ackermann-deep.coolexe:
Ackermann(3, 10) is 8189

@number-of-cache-memory-misses  335490659
@exit(0)

It's different from yours, but the difference is minor.
I guess it's due to the different operation order in I_CALL and I_RETURN.
But the main-memory-writes is hugely different from the sample solution.

What's your output for basic.coolexe, mine is following:
@number-of-main-memory-reads-(fast-jeq) 7
@number-of-main-memory-writes   0
@number-of-cache-memory-hits    4
@number-of-cache-memory-misses  7
@exit(0)

But the sample is 11, I can't understand how main memory writes is counted, can you help? Thanks a lot.

Hi,

Stuck on printing a string. Confused how the string is held in the memory, looking at 
the coolc webpage confuses me further as integers are held at the addresses.. is the 
itoa() func needed, not sure what to base the integer conversion off, I've tried the 
seemingly obvious. Struggling to get a string from the ints provided at the addresses.

Confusingly, the amount of memory addresses doesn't correspond with the length of the 
string or the amount of unique characters.

Any hints?

looks like there are a lot of ways to implement the cache

here is my result for ackermann.coolexe with cache

Ackermann(3, 2) is 29
@number-of-main-memory-reads            4947
@number-of-main-memory-writes           2860
@number-of-cache-memory-hits            11025
@number-of-cache-memory-misses          4947

and with fast-jeq
Ackermann(3, 2) is 29
@number-of-main-memory-reads-(fast-jeq) 4769
@number-of-main-memory-writes           2824
@number-of-cache-memory-hits            10663
@number-of-cache-memory-misses          4769


my reads here are lower than yours but im not sure why, the only thing i found here 
is that the difference between my memory reads and yours in the ackermann.coolexe 
(without fast-jeq) is 32 which matches the @maximum-function-call-depth value. maybe 
as you have said the difference might be in I_RETURN or I_CALL. But now im 
suspecting something else.

does the order of our memory reads/writes matter in the cache if they do not matter 
in the instruction implementation?

for example, if you have popped a value (using SP) then have read a value (using PC) 
those two are independent of each other. but it might be that the order affect the 
reads/writes have a domino affect on the cache locations and thus the output stats.

Now I just tested this, and yes the order of the operation does matter sadly :(
Here is an example of what I had in the I_CALL(not completely true and just an 
example)
1 - get the next PC (aka next word) value from the memory using PC
2 - push the current FP to the TOS

theoretically, these two are independent of each other when it comes to the result 
and the path of the program. but they did change the stats when i flipped them 

1 - push the current FP to the TOS
2 - get the next PC (aka next word) value from the memory using PC

and here is the output 
(no fast-jeq, with my_cache)
Ackermann(3, 2) is 29
@number-of-main-memory-reads            4960
@number-of-main-memory-writes           2859
@number-of-cache-memory-hits            11012
@number-of-cache-memory-misses          4960


as you can see this is different from the first stats reported above..


I think we should wait for Chris to tell us what best to do, it is not reasonable to 
try all different read/write memory orders to match the sample solution result (which 
still there is 
no guarantee that this is might be the only issue).

Hello, here's the question. After an update, it is still not WL2 when running myUbuntu (start-
CLI). Only # is displayed. Can you tell me what code to type next?
In addition, can this code be more detailed? Docker run --rm it -v /Users/YOUR_USERNAME /FOLDER 
(file name) : /home/labs -w /home/labs --name Ubuntu Ubuntu :latest bash
Everything else is the same. Does this code run on CMD or docker-myUbuntu? In which step
You may need to be more specific.

The above is crucial to understanding what's happening.
Our machine's words are 16-bits, 2 bytes, wide, so each can hold 2 characters.

Also remember that C strings are NULL-byte terminated so, while strlen("abc") is 3, it 
requires 4 bytes (2 words) to store it.  Similarly  strlen("abcd") is 4, so requires 5 byte - 
but all data in our machine must align on a word boundary,  so "abcd" actually needs 6 bytes, 
3 words.

The NULL byte is stored, so you can start from the first word, and print each *character* 
until you reach the NULL byte.

Hope that helps,

You type that command into CMD, to start a new Linux container running within Docker
(I cannot remember whether than Linux container sends its output to the same CMD window, or within the 
Docker GUI - but, easy to tell!).

Hi, 


I'm having troubling trying to understand when the cache writes into the main_memory. 
 From my understanding the write-back will only write back into the main_memory if 
current block (in the cache) we are tryin to write in is occupied (valid=true) by 
"dirty" data. Then we perform the action of copying the current data in the cache back 
into the main_memory then we can write the new information into the cache. 

Using the the emptystatement.coolexe as an example. I counted that each of the 
instruction would be a cache-miss (i.e. 8 instruction = 8 misses). Then the cache hits 
will be when we read_memory() in the return case(i.e. (one for TOS + one for PREV FP + 
one for return ADDRS) = 3 total) and when we finally read the TOS at the end (3 + 1 = 
4). And if you set up the indexing using (address MOD 32) no same cache slot is 
needed? So I thought it only needs 1 main-memory-write(i.e. for the final TOS in 
cache?), but I'm obviously wrong because the number-main-memory-writes is 12 (so is it 
just writing back every instruction even though it is clean?).
Could someone please me out. 
Any help would be greatly appreciate, Thank you.


Kind regards,

Hey,

We are having the same issue here
https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help2002?p=np&a=305&all=y13
It seems that the sample solution memory reads are way higher than our solutions.
At some point I thought the sample solution has the write-through policy not the write-back. I 
didn't test the write-through yet so we are just waiting for Chris to help us.

If one address holds the two characters and indexing it provides the one char, I'm lost to how we 
are meant to access that second byte / char from the words stored.

(a slightly different wording of the problem)

If I have an integer value,  say 28,
how do I 'extract' from it the two values of '2' and '8' ?

I was able to replicate the sample solution results to every example finally!

I'm still confused as to why this is happening but from what I can see in my code this is not a write-back policy 
based on what I have read in OS textbooks and it is much closer to a write-through where cache and memory are always 
in sync! (this partially explains the higher memory writes)

I will comment here back about what is going on after I clean the code a bit more and understand it more.

Modulo operator

28 mod 100 / 10 = 2
28 mod 10 = 8

each word stores multiple characters (in this case two because each char is 8 bit but the block/word size is 16 
bit)
for the string, u can use a bitwise shift to move to the next character in the word.

Same issue here. Looks like i've got some optimizing to do (I have a slightly larger amount of cache misses).
```

@percentage-of-cache-hits-(not-required)        73.61%
```

I was able to get something near the example output by changing my write_memory() function to be less optimized. 
Obviously can't go into the specifics but it seems by changing it to bypass a certain block of code and go directly to 
the modify_cache_block() function, i was able to get similar results. I don't think this changes my implementation to a 
write-through cache, because it only writes when the block->state is DIRTY. The issue is that this less optimal 
implementation essentially skips the address check (Does not check if the block address matches), but still checks the 
block dirtiness. So it's like an implementation which 'half-checks' and has the efficiency between a write-back cache and 
a write-though cache (I do remember that when I was trying to solve this a while ago that simply doing a write-through 
cache had worse performance than the example).
Sorry for the wall of text! Hope this helps

Since we will be talking a lot about writing i think it is better if we moved our discussion to here

Hey Peter,

how do you know if an address is dirty if you don't know whether the address matches the cache block? the 
dirtiness of a cache is tight to its cache location.

and I'm guessing the writeback happens in the read part of the cache when it sees the memory as being 
dirty right?

Also may I ask if you are setting the cache location as dirty when you write or when you miss a read?

Hi OP,

Peter's reply is a very good hint (though a tiny bit more complicated than needs be).

Forget the concern of 'a 5 digit number'.
We have a 16-bit word, which we know can be considered a 2 x 8-bit integers (C's characters are just small 
integers).

Imagine a (non-existent) computer in which decimal numbers were stored as their sequence of decimal digits, such 
that when storing the integer 28, it'd store the '2' in one position and the '8' in the next position.
As Peter has shown, we can separate the two digits using simple arithmetic:

  tensdigit  = value / 10;  (a bit simpler than Peter's)
  unitsdigit = value % 10;

It's very similar to the standard atoi() function, just doing it 'backwards'.

We have the almost exact situation with our character string, and we don't need any indexing (a better word than 
subscriptable) to extract each character.

And you may still hit the 'NUXI' problem (you'll know it when you see it!)

Don't think I can word it any clearer, without just giving it away!

______
Actually, historically, while I don't think any computer *hardware* actually supported one-decimal-digit-per-byte, 
the still-going-strong, very-high-paying COBOL programming language, developed in 1957 :

  https://www.infoworld.com/article/3596594/the-future-of-cobol-is-now.html

has a data format termed a PICTURE, in which each decimal digit is stored in individual bytes, and arithmetic (of 
arbitrary length) is performed by 'adding', etc, the digits.

1) So by removing my other code that resulted in less writes, seems like you don't need to know if the address 
matches. Essentially, it will always write dirty blocks even if it can save a write (such as writing to the 
same address that maps to the same block twice - in my original case it wont write at all, but removing the 
check means it will always write twice because the block is DIRTY). Not sure if this answers the question hope 
it helps

2) Yes that is correct.

3) The only point which a block is marked as DIRTY is when a write occurs. So that is regardless of whether the 
address matches or not when a write occurs.

The trade-off with running this particular program is take it takes ~45 seconds to 
compute on my low-power ARM-based laptop versus the 10 seconds it used to take with 
my direct-mapped cache implementation, but I think that's something I could clear up 
by writing my own C code to be more cache-friendly. There are no noticeable waits for 
the other test programs.

Is there a penalty for not exactly matching the sample solution's statistics? Is 
there a penalty for a complex, recursive program such as ackermann-deep.cool?

Thanks.

hmmm interesting
1 - so it will always use the main memory write when writing to the cache right?

3 - yeah make sense, that is what is supposed to happen in a write-back policy



I will try to replicate your result instead of telling you how I was able to reach the sample solution so no wrong 
thingy can happen from my side.

After I'm able to replicate your result we will be able to understand what is the issue and what we can do to make 
sense of it.

You don't have to help me replicate your result if you don't have the time its alright, I'm just trying to 
understand the project more and having another separate code with a different implementation will maybe help us spot 
the issue.

But first, we need to agree on common things for us to be able to replicate each other's results.

1 - Are you able to make every memory read related to the PC register as always the first memory read in an 
instruction?
so for example, you can pop something from the TOS (read_memory(SP);) or you can read the next word 
(read_memory(PC);) these two functions do not affect each other when it comes to their result, but they will affect 
the cache. So try to make PC related memory reads first then the SP next. For example, instead of 
(foo=read_memory(PC++);foos=read_memory(--SP);bar=read_memory(PC++);bars=read_memory(--SP);) do 
(foo=read_memory(PC++);bar=read_memory(PC++);foos=read_memory(--SP);bars=read_memory(--SP);)


2 - Also at the end after popping the TOS value (the exist value) write back every dirty data from the cache to the 
main memory.

After doing the 2 points show me the result of ackermann-deep.coolexe (don't worry the 2 changes above will not break the 
code but will change the cache reads/writes numbers a little bit, but just in case create a copy of your 
existing code somewhere else before doing the edits).

I will try to replicate your result and get back to you, from there we can discuss the changes that we would need to 
do to make the code match the sample solution and see whether those changes really make the cache policy a "write-
back" policy

Hey lightgreen ANONYMOUS,

we are having the same issue here that started on this thread 
https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help2002?p=np&a=305&all=y17
then it shifted to this thread (will continue here)
https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help2002?p=np&a=405&all=y4

Based on what I remember in the workshop Chris said that the number should exactly match since that is 
what the automated testing will look for. But maybe he might change that, maybe not, we will wait and 
see.

As far as I remember, the cache should be implemented with direct mapping since the cache should be fast 
in nature. implementing a complex re-placement policy that makes the cache slower is defeating the 
purpose of the cache in the first place which should be fast. but maybe if your placement policy is 
implemented in the hardware level (which is how the cache in real life is implemented) then it might be 
faster :).
check this thread here:
https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help2002?p=np&a=264&all=y2

also keep in mind that in the project description it says "There is only one single cache location for 
each main-memory location, but many potential main-memory locations for each cache location." that is 
direct-mapping, if there are multiple cache locations for each main-memory location then I'm not sure if 
that will match the project description.

FOR DEBUGGING PURPOSES ONLY you can add the flag "-O3" to the compiler command "cc .." the default O is 
0 "-O0" so making it -O3 will make the compiler do more optimization to the code, although this is not 
recommended since in the marking they will run it with "cc -std=c11 -Wall -Werror -o runcool runcool.c" 
so it is better to make it faster in the first place. If "-O1" made it a lot faster then there is a lot 
of room for cleaning up the code.

Hope this helps.

I can't seem to save and run coolexe files on my laptop. I use the website but can't save 
the files as they disappear in 20 seconds, so I tried coolc.sh, which seemed as though they 
were saving to my laptop, but then the results are wrong when I execute them. I tested to 
see if my code was at fault by using the workshop 5 example but that's running fine so it 
must be a problem with the coolexe file. Can anyone help?

I downloaded ackermann-deep.coolexe from the website just now and tested it, it worked fine on 
my machine with my code.

the workshop example i think does not provide a method for reading the coolexe file, you need to 
implement the reading function (you will see it down in the main function) that can read the 
coolexe file program which consist of the AWORDs that should be placed in the main memory.

also other instructions should be implemented that were not implemented in the workshop such as 
CALL and RETURN which are the first main things you should be focusing on. IF you got these two 
working then the rest of the instructions would be easy.

Alright, so seems like the slight variation is indeed due to the order of the read_memory and write_memory. I was able to move 
some stuff around and I got these statistics for ackermann-deep.coolexe which are better:
peter@[REDACTED] (master) :) $ ./runcool ./cool_binaries/ackermann-deep.coolexe

@percentage-of-cache-hits-(not-required)        73.94%

RETURN and CALL are the two most complex instructions (IMO), so obviously these were the two that I had to move some variables 
around to increase the hit ratio. 

And here is a direct-mapped, write-*through* cache result

peter@[REDACTED] (master) :) $ ./runcool ./cool_binaries/ackermann-deep.coolexe

As you can see, the write values are obviously much larger than the sample results to be correct. Apart from the obvious 
reason that the project description specifies a write-back cache, this is what leads me to believe that the website isn't 
(incorrectly) using a write-through cache.

Marking this seems like it will be interesting. Could try and use generate statistics for every permutation of write_memory() 
and read_memory() order but that seems like insanity. The other solution is using a certain tolerance but I would guess that 
will miss out a lot of incorrect implementations. Or some program that attempts to transform the input source to the solution 
source by swapping the lines in a way that does not break the instruction (also seems complicated).

I'm going to wait for further clarifications, seems like from the stats others are posting I've got the write-back working

Hey Peter,

I was able to replicate your number of writes (yes mine is 10 writes bigger because at the end I write every dirty data to the main 
memory back again which you should do btw :) )

@number-of-main-memory-reads-(fast-jeq) 334792394

@number-of-cache-memory-misses          334792394

but I cant replicate your reads, were you using fast-jeq?
are you sure that every PC read is always on top of any of SP reads in an instruction?

May I ask if you can avoid trying to optimize the order of memory reads for cache hits for now? (just so you know one key for 
making my code match the sample solution is placing PC memory reads first before SP reads). if we both have the same order of 
memory reads then we would be able to compare each others output stats with regards to the cache, having different read memory 
orders will affect the number of reads.

Be very careful when using -O3.
(Believe it or not) both gcc and clang offer no guarantees that -O3 optimization produces faster or even correct 
code.  You may be lucky if both your regression tests succeed and your run-times are lower,  but if you only 
focus on run-times, the possible results are next to useless.

Hello,

I can't quite understand whether you're having problems with the website
(as no-one else has reported similar problems), or not.  I suspect it's
more a mis-understanding about the 'workflow', as the first reply has
explained.

The .coolexe file is available for only 20seconds, because with tens
of students accessing the website at the same time (hopefully not
maliciously!), I wish to keep the disk free of no-longer- required
temporary files.  If you feel that 20secs is not long enough to download
a .coolexe file over a slow network connection, the time limit could be
increased a bit.

Unsure what this means:

  > but then the results are wrong when I execute them.

The code developed in Workshop-5 is a minimal example to get students
started; far from a complete solution against which you should compare
anything (and if it did everything, what would you need to complete??)

OK, have I've finally read through all the comments about memory reads and
writes and collecting statistics.  Has been really impressive following the
conversations, and trying to reverse-engineer your collective
reverse-engineering of the sample solution!

When planning this project, Amitava, the lab facilitators, and I all held
early discussions about how difficult, or how easy, to make the project so
that (as ever) the majority of students would be able to complete it, and
learn enough from it.  We discussed more difficult versions, with multi-line
caches, tracking locality-of-reference, and cache replacement policies. All
good fun extensions but, given the available time and size of a solution, we
settled on what we have.  Hopefully, somewhere in the middle.  Clearly those
contributing to the three longer threads, here, on memory and caching are
well advanced with their projects - great! - but we'll see what happens in
the final 2 weeks when the silent majority (of 300?) reach this point, and
read this sequence of posts.  And hopefully not simply replicate the
conversations without reading!

The standard sample solution, as shared amongst the lab facilitators (and
markers), is probably the most basic one possible that meets the project's
requirements - direct-mapped, write-back cache, with no additional
replacement policy. Each cache entry maintains its contents, the RAM address
being mirrored, and a single dirty-tag.  No valid-tag.  The cache needs to
be initialised, and is done so by marking all locations as initially dirty.
That means that the initial read or write for each location will result in a
write-back,  so care must be taken as to where that occurs so as not to
'wipe-out' the initial program or data.  This is why even the smallest of
cool programs have some writes, as a 'start-up' cost (often described in
textbooks as 'warming up' the cache.  If the dirty-tags were, instead,  all
set to false, then the first reads from cache will get - what?

So all programs will have a 'start-up' cost of, at most, the size of the
cache (i.e. up to 32 additional writes),  which is quite insignificant for
more realistic, longer-running programs, making millions of read requests.
Of course, students are mostly noticing this when they run very small
programs and, often, just a single program, without having anything to
compare it to.

So, why no valid-tag instead? Just for simplicity.  Solutions which employ a
valid-tag avoid this startup-up cost by working out if the cache location
has every been used before.  But with only a single CPU/core accessing a
single cache, and no DMA to modify memory without the cache's knowledge, the
valid-tag never needs/can change once *it* has warmed-up.  Thus, such
solutions are always (eventually) checking an unchanging valid-tag.

Things fell off the rails when Purple Square Anonymous suggested we could
reduce the number of memory reads by reviewing the JEQ instruction.  Great
to see the detective work, and it worked, so I felt it worwhile to support
both 'versions' of memory-read statistics, and report them on the webpage.
That was possible (and eventually got it correct!) until support for the
write-back cache was added.  Depending on whether the JEQ-false branches
were taken, or not, the values held in cache, over time, diverge and the
attempt to report both 'versions' of statistics becomes incorrect.  You
don't see this in programs without JEQ, or even very small programs, but
many here have latched on to ackermann-deep.cool as a program that really
exercises the cache with its very deep stack.

SO - what to do about the varying statistics, so that people's early efforts
are rewarded, but not to scare off the silent majority?  The sample solution
on the webpage now implements the 4 combinations of things being discussed,
and each is a conditionally-compiled and executed program so that its
variants (hmmm, word of the year) don't interfere with each other.  A bit of
effort, but it's demonstrative in showing the differences across a variety
of programs of different sizes and instruction mixes.

I'm very confident that it's correct in all 4 cases and, yes, it's certainly
a write-back cache and not a write-through cache, once it's warmed up.  We
could add a valid-tag, and even a time/instruction-counter approach to LRU
replacement, as one of our lab facilitators, James, and couple of students
have shown me.  Yes, they can achieve better cache performance, measured
solely in cache-hits, but *may* suffer if the additional hardware required
to build them slowed them down (I'm unsure, in the general case, but the
3rd- paragraph of this post:
https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help2002?p=np&a=422 shows that we *can*
get carried away).

I don't plan to add any additional variants to the sample solution,  so
hopefully all the great reverse-engineers here can make their solutions now
match one of the two sample solutions with caching, and that'll make marking
so much easier and transparent!

Please continue the relevant discussion in THIS THREAD, and let me know if you
agree with what you're now seeing.

(I'll now be offline until Monday; ahhh, sunshine at last!)

Good morning, 

I am having quite a bit of trouble understanding what the stack instructions are asking of me. 

I understand the arithmetic based ones, however once it gets to the "call" instruction and so forth, I am confused by what is meant by:

" The word following the 'call' instruction holds the address of the required function's first instruction."

The 'word following the [word] instruction" is what is confusing. Are we meant to access the words provided in the *INSTRUCTION_name[] array. If so would we need to index this array to obtain the word that the instruction is after?

I am really sorry, I feel really confused with what is meant by "the word following" or "The word immediately following the jmp instruction" 

I would greatly appreciate some clarity.

Thank you and Happy Father's day to all the dads (:

In the instruction sheet, sub is "the second subtracted from the first". is this v2-v1 or 
v1-v2? I suspect the later, and similarly for div "the second divided from the first" 
would be v1/v2. Please let me know if my understanding is correct.

Due to the fact that stacks are first in last out [FILO], the first value popped from the stack will 
be the second number that was pushed before the arithmetic operation. The second value popped from the 
stack will then be the first number that was pushed.

e.g. if we have the statement: "3 - 2", the 3 will be pushed to the stack followed by the 2. When 
popping from the top of the stack the 2 will be popped first and then the 3 after that. This also 
happens with division.

Therefore: v2 - v1

It means the next value in memory, indicated by the program counter (PC). 
if you look on the coolc website (https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/coolc?p=np&demo=parameters.cool)
at the contents of the executable files, it is the 16-bit-word directly following a call instruction.

I hope this helps

Hi,

I'm still struggling to figure out exactly where the TOS should be copied to when the Return instruction is given.

" The value immediately following the return opcode indicates where the function's returned value should be copied before the function returns - to the location of FP+value of the current function's stack frame."

I'm not sure how to read that. What is the value of the current functions stack frame, and how does the value after the opcode effect it?

Thankyou.

At the end of execute_stackmachine we have a return statement(return read_memory(SP);)

Thanks, looks like I've got it working!

Had to move around a read to make it the exact number in the CALL instruction 
(because of how the order affects whether a cache miss occurs/not).


Initially, I had a EMPTY value for my state enum, but now I'm doing the 
initialization stage by setting the address of each cache line to some memory 
address starting from N_MAIN_MEMORY_WORDS-1 (starting at the bottom of the stack) In 
this process, I am not reading from memory or modifying the value of the cache as 
I'm assuming the bottom 32 values of the memory are not text/program data, and 
therefore are part of the stack and initially zero.

Not sure if it is safe to assume that this region of memory will never contain 
text/program data? I'm assuming this because we've already assumed that the text 
segment and stack never collides, and because initializing with reads from the stack 
will add +32 reads, which is impossible for some program solutions that have less 
reads than this.

Hi Chris,

 From what I have read am I right in assuming if my statistics don't match the 1 of the 4 
test outputs I will lose marks?

Currently I am getting fewer cache misses, main memory reads and fewer main memory writes 
as well as more cache hits than the 'fast-jeq' examples (the same jeq implementation that I 
am using). In every metric my cache is apparently running better than in the test sample. 

I am getting the correct behaviour and outputs from the test files and I have also 
implemented all of the optional metrics and they are identical to the sample outputs, which 
leads me to believe that my cache is working as intended and the metrics do not differ due 
to errors in logic. My cache is also directly mapped and write-back using only a dirty flag 
and holding only the contents and memory location of each memory entry (the same as your 
sample solution) 

I have not specifically tried to optimise my cache, this is just the logic I came up with 
to get it working. I am hoping that I will not have to modify my code to make it "worse" as 
this seems counterproductive.

can you please let me know if my current solution is fine?

Travis's response is very helpful, but a further polite and serious suggestion -

the computer in front of you has executed 100,000+ lines of code just to post your question.
It's a significant experimental tool, that's almost impossible to break.

You could have answered your own question by using your computer as an experimental tool, rather than 
seeking a clarification -  write a simple cool program that does nothing other than  "print 12 / 5;"
Knowing the correct (expected) answer, you can then implement both possibilities for the I_DIV 
instruction, recompiled and run your solution, and seen which possibility implements the desired 
result.  Autodidacticism.

Good luck,

(moreover, this very topic was discussed during Workshop-4).

The words being referred to are not English words, or strings describing the 17 instructions.
They are the 16-bit words of the stack-machine's memory, each of which holds an instruction,
an integer, or an address.

Some instructions are 'self-contained', they only require one word (holding the instruction) to fully
indicate what's required.  Other instructions require the following word to provide additional
information about how to execute the instruction.
If the instruction is in memory location  N,  any required additional information is in location  N+1.

Hello Travis,

Sounds impressive;  would you mind *emailing* me, not posting, your solution?
I'm keen to see how you've done this (hopefully without adding complexity).

Wondering if some of the difference is due to this:

There's no additional marks in the marking schema for outpacing the sample solution,  so it will keep 
life a lot simpler (for the markers, and those addressing your Appeal) if you're able to submit 
something matching the sample.  You can still keep your improved solution for our career portfolio :-)

I believe it's safe, because stack locations should always be written to before be being read 
back, so they can't have anything critical in them.


So, yes (though I wish you hadn't given so much of the game away).

Write some different cool programs, with main() calling a function(), and add different numbers (0, 1, 2) of parameters
and local variables to the function.  Compile each program, and watch how, to where, that value for FP+value changes
for each program.

When in doubt, experiment with the tools you have.

If you're returning (or just using) the value on the TOS, then that value must have recently been 
pushed to the TOS.  If you have a cache implemented, that value will be in the cache as a 
consequence of the push, and so shouldn't require a read of main-memory to pop it off again.

Some students have asked how we came up with the set of 17 instructions for the 1st project, whether 
17 was some magic number, and whether it could be done with fewer.

Well, there's nothing magic about 17, and it's easy to imagine/desire a few more helpful instructions 
to reduce the execution speed of programs - INCREMENT and DECREMENT are two obvious examples,  and 
with an OFFSET instruction we could easily add arrays into Cool.  But, can't have it all in a 3 week 
project!

Some may be interested in this amazing project, which compiles C programs into x86 programs that 
consistent entirely of 'mov' (move) instructions - so an instruction set with just one instruction:

  https://github.com/xoreaxeaxeax/movfuscator/tree/master/overview

I may have missed the sarcasm, but there's no need to flush cache values back to main-memory if the whole program is just about to terminate!

But, whether or not these apparent optimisations work depends on where values on the stack 'land' in main-memory, and will be different for 
different programs, and different data values that steer the instruction sequence through conditionals.
Unless you have some history-reinventing theory?

I have a question about this part, when the cache is initialized with dirty flags, 
at first it will do at most 32 write-back (correct me if im wrong with this).
But a write-back usually take the content of the cache and write it back to the main 
memory, but the cache initially is full of random data since it is empty (and 
dirty). So why do i write the first cache dirty data back to the main memory if they 
contain no data in the warmup phase?


And I have small question here:
> I'm very confident that it's correct in all 4 cases and, yes, it's certainly
> a write-back cache and not a write-through cache, once it's warmed up.

 From what i understood here is that in the warming up phase, dirty flags will be 
used for the write-back, but after the warm-up it will act as a write-through since 
the dirty flag will not be used after that. May I ask if you can correct my 
interpretation here if I'm wrong?. 


The "@number-of-main-memory-writes" stats indicates the number of writes to the 
"main_memory" array and DOES NOT include the cache writes. May I ask if I'm correct?

I was able to match all of the 4 sample solutions. It is just that I'm struggling to  
structure my code to make it seem and look like a write-back cache policy so i don't 
lose marks on the other part of the marking. 
These three questions i wrote here currently leads me to believe that the "dirty" 
flag act like the "valid" flag, since there is no useful data in the cache in the 
warmup phase to write it back to the main memory, it is redundant to write-back 
empty data to the main memory (for example to the TOS) before loading another data 
in the warming up phase, i can just load them directly without writing anything to 
the main memory. That is why I thought it is a write-through. If there are millions 
of reads/writes and most of them are write-through but only 32 are write-back then 
I'm not sure if what I have is fully write-back cache policy.

Maybe helping me out with the three questions might clarify some cache context about 
what is needed in the project and what the extra stuff that textbooks tells us to do 
but not actually needed in the project.

The coolexe files hold a series of 16-bit (2 byte) words in sequence, to get them into memory you 
would have to load 2 bytes at a time each into sequential memory locations.
I found fread quite useful for this.
P.S. an int is 2 bytes in size ;)

Wishing that you were NOT posting such detailed descriptions of your project.

- it's akin to sharing source code,
- it's the very reason we encourage students to work in pairs, and
- it dissuades other students from reading a chapter from a textbook once they see a pre-digested 
summary.

How do you know if it's the first access? If you introduce an extra tag, it will become set, but 
then never be changed again.

I think you're confusing the role of a dirty and a valid tag.

Hi,

In the project specification, it states " the only supported datatype is the signed integer, ranging from -32,768 to 32,767. "

and that " memory addresses may be considered as unsigned integers, ranging from 0 to 65535. "

but the starting code initializes main memory with AWORD, which are the unsigned integers.

I've managed to instead fill main memory with IWORDs, but I've run into a few further problems and I'm wondering if I'm even on the right track?

I'm getting correct read/write numbers, but some of my printed results are all over the place, particularly in the factorial program, where I'm getting 1!=92, 2!=2754. I've combed over everything repeatedly for days, and I'm just not sure what's going wrong?

Thanks.

Hi,
I've tried fread to get the 16-bits keywords into main memory but when I print the 
main_memory to check whether it looks the same with the sample .coolexe, after each 
instruction, a 0 is added in to the main_memory. Any hints on why is that?

Also, the read and write functions and the initialized array both use AWORD,
even though the project specifications state that the machine should only accept IWORD.

Is this intentional?

Hey Chris,

My solution for ackerman-deep.coolexe gives

Ackermann(3, 10) is 8189
@number-of-main-memory-reads-(fast-jeq)         334792394
@number-of-main-memory-writes                   424630003
@number-of-cache-memory-hits                    939105807
@number-of-cache-memory-misses                  334792394

@number-of-instructions-(not-required)          446983257
@number-of-function-calls-(not-required)        44698326
@maximum-function-call-depth-(not-required)     8192
@maximum-stack-depth-(not-required)             40956
@percentage-of-cache-hits-(not-required)        73.7%

@exit(0)

All values match the sample solution with cache and fast jeq apart from @number-of-main-memory-
writes which for me is the same as the sample with no cache.

mine:                 424630003
sample:               424630025
sample w/ cache:      424630003

the same is true of other simpler programs:

arithmetic.coolexe:
mine:                 9
sample:               24
sample w/ cache:      9

nestedloops.coolexe:
mine:                 349
sample:               377
sample w/ cache:      349

I found through testing that the discrepency is due to the 'start-up cost'.

In the sample solution when a cache address is first accessed with a low memory address (where the 
program is stored) @number-of-main-memory-writes is incremented, but not if it is first accessed 
with a stack address.

I don't see why either is nessesary.

In my solution I initialise the cache to point to the corresponding stack addresses so the data is 
not dirty since we never read from stack addresses that haven't previously been written to and 
writing to them causes them to be flagged as dirty.

This way there is no start-up cost assocciated with the cache.

Not sure if I've missed some edge case where it is nessesary, due to our assumption that the program 
and the stack won't overlap.

Thanks for your help

I had a similar issue, it turned out I was only reading in 1 byte of data at a time. I recommend a 
hex/binary editor so you can see the layout of the data in the file. It helped me understand what 
to expect in memory and how to work with it, especially when it came to strings

Unsure what you mean by 'work around'.
The code in the boot-segment calls your main() function, which returns, and then the Halt 
instruction causes the program to terminate. The Halt is not to be avoided.

It's unclear from your question (which sounds like you have close to the right idea) what 
you have tried.  There's a small limited number of possibilities as to the correct order of 
modifying/saving the 3 on-CPU registers.

*Experiment* with the possibilities;  it'll be obvious when it works, and when it doesn't. 
Then, when you've found the combination that works, reason why it works.

Do not just ask for the answer as your first attempt.
Work with your partner to plan the *simple* experiments, and discuss your observations.

Also I am confused by the 'main memory writes' statistic. In the sample solution, this stat is higher in 
the version with cache implemented than without. Surely it should be way lower due to the write-back 
policy of the cache.

In my solution I'm calculating it as though it is 'n_cache_writes' which almost matches the sample 
solutions.(differing by the 'start up cost')

if i calculate it as 'n_write_backs' i get a number way lower than the sample.

eg. ackerman-deep.coolexe:
n_cache_writes: 424630003 (sample: 424630025)
n_write_backs: 249263375

Any pointers/clarification would be appreciated.

I have pretty much done all of the functions but pushr is a little convoluted. In the 
description pushr is said to 'provides the offset to be added to the FP to provide the 
address of the integer value to be pushed onto the stack' which insinuates that the 
command following pushr and the offset will be a pushc or an athematic operator (given that 
the statement is 'value TO be pushed onto the stack' insinuating it is yet to be put on the 
stack). 
When I look at the provided code though, pushr seems to be used in any number of ways 
particularly in ackerman where pushr is used immediately after the function call and 
followed by a 'jeq' (which pops things off the stack not pushes) which I assume is 
giving the address for the result following the conditional jump but if the follow the 
logic at the jumped to address there is another pushr!

Could someone please clarify it's use case?

So you get an address and access the value located there and push it onto the stack. I don't 
think that the statement 'value TO be pushed onto the stack' precludes that the value is 
already on the stack.

I trust that this question is asked with reference to some other programming/exercise, as 
fork+exec is certainly not required for our 1st project?

The 'trick' is to remember that calling fork() results in the parent's memory being duplicated, 
and that includes any pending/buffered output that hasn't yet been flushed to its intended 
destination (often the screen).

So, *before* calling fork() call fflush() to send any pending output, call fork(), and then 
each of the parent and child processes continue with their empty buffers.

The parent and child do not share their output buffers, so no action by the parent can force 
the child's output to appear.

There is no need to flush any process's output on termination - that's 'automatically' 
performed by exit().  If you don't want the output to be flushed, call _exit().


> So how do I run printf statements that are inside the child process?

With the above, no special actions required.

You don't really need to pop the local variables and parameters if you just (already) know where 
you want the SP to end up when control is back in the caller.

You'll also notice that if your function doesn't have a return statement, that coolc will 
generate code for an implicit return.

However, this situation/problem doesn't just arise when returning from functions - any local 
variables defined inside a new block {...} also need to be popped when that block is completed, 
and the body of a function is just a standard block (but with optional parameters).

Look at the code generated for nestedloops.cool

Further to this,  if the data you wish to read in is 16-bits wide (our AWORD and IWORD user-defined datatypes),

I've also found that you can save a huge number of writes if you don't write-back a value that is the same as the 
new value - again, depending on the program being tested. We'll be (have to) marking submissions using programs 
where it's a lot easier to 'see' why there are savings due to the cache  (using lots of, or long, strings for 
example).

But I don't think the 'arms-race' is really healthy.
It's easy to come up with tweaks and heuristics to lower the statistical counts,
but whether these changes would provide any real improvement if implemented in cache hardware,
each with associated timing costs, across a wide variety of different sized examples and
memory reference patterns, is up for debate.

It's a necessary assumption, unless additional tags are added to the cache housekeeping.  It also presumes that 
the highest memory addresses are used for the stack, and used in the traditional manner for a stack,  which is a 
reasonable assumption (for our cool programs), but may not always be true on a more 'weird' system. We wouldn't 
normally expect the cache to know/assume what certain regions of memory will be used for.


[historic note - we once had separate cache types for read-only and read-write data segments]

Yes, that was a blunder introduced when adding comments, and accidentally commenting out a return statement :-(
Updated solution doing far better now.

I'm starting to have a problem with the assessment of this project as a whole...

I'm currently only one cache-hit away from matching the sample solution statistics for 
ackermann.cool. I've resorted to rearranging the read_memory and write_memory calls in my 
op-code implementations (guessing as to how it appears in the sample source code), since in 
deeply-recursive functions such as Ackermann the order significantly affects cache hits. 

This to me feels like, as a result of this assessment style, the point of learning how to 
program is being missed. Instead of being given a benchmark to surpass, within the provided 
limitations, encouraging us to learn about and implement caching-designs that increase 
cache-hits and decrease main-memory access, I'm at a stage now where my time is consumed 
poking around in the dark, guessing about how the source code has been written in the 
sample solution in order to perfectly match these baseline statistics.

I would prefer for the marking to be changed so that, instead of having to perfectly match 
the sample solution statistics, we have to match or exceed a certain amount of cache-hits 
as well as match or go below a certain amount of main memory accesses for each test case. I 
currently have a design that emulates caching hardware based off what's described in the 
recommended textbook that succeeds in both of these criteria, but I've spent ten's of hours 
at this point rolling back what I've implemented and resorting to guessing someone else's 
source code (which doesn't make sense for the simulation of a real-world programming 
problem anyway). My main point, therefore, is that the current automated-marking approach 
seems to discourage the point of programming/engineering, where one is given a problem and 
is tasked to try and solve it in the best way possible.

Forgive me if I've missed some important information though. This project is actually quite 
cool, and I've loved learning about how to program with caching and the stack in mind.

The goal is not to match, or outwit the sample solution.
The goal is, as you've described, to implement something producing the correct *results* (execution by 
the program),  and not the identical statistical measures given that there are many ways to implement, 
and measure, the 'same' thing.

The sample is meant to be a sample, not the only definitive solution.
I should not have mentioned anything about the exactness of the metrics in the Workshop
(and the project description makes no such mention).

I'll make this clear in a Clarification, soon
(hinted at too often, but not clearly enough stated).


(personally, I loathe automated marking, of anything, for the very reasons that you've described in your 
post - it thwarts creativity (which UWA's Assessment Policy also kills), and it sets the wrong targets 
for students.  As ever, more resources (=money) for marking would be a start).

Wow this would have been really good to know earlier, I definately had the impression the stats had to match 
for the automated marking component and have spent many hours trying to reverse engineer the implementation in 
the sample.

I have otherwise really enjoyed the project and learning about the stack.

Hey Chris,

I find myself slightly confused about the whole "startup" cost of our cache and why 
it is necessary to initialize all dirty tags to dirty.

Why is it not possible to initialize all the tags to be the highest addresses of 
main memory, and leave the dirty bit as clean. Since everything on the stack will be 
written to before it is ever read, this would work and there is no need to write-
back any of the initial cache values. 

Thanks in advance

Yesterday I was testing some of my own executable files using the provided coolc

main-memory-writes seem to all be lower than I recall?

Originally my program matched the sample but not anymore.

Not complaining or anything, just wanting to double check whether or not it has indeed 
changed in some way. I looked on the clarifications page but couldn't seem to find any

The description for these instructions are "the two integers on the TOS are popped 
from the stack, (+,-,*,/) together, and the result left on the TOS"

Does popping mean the pushed integers should be removed from the stack completely (set 
to 0) once there result has been pushed on the stack?

For example in arithmetic.coolexe 2,3 and 4 are pushed onto the stack.
MULT goes first with 3 * 4 to make 12. Once this 12 is on the stack should 3 & 4 not 
be?
Then ADD goes with 12 + 2 to make 14. Once this 14 is on the stack should 12 & 2 not 
be?

If this is the case is the only way to remove them with a write_memory(SP, 0); 
statement?
This seems like it would cause to many write_memory reads.

Or am I wrong completely and the values can stay on the stack.

Any help would be appreciated.

Not sure what you mean by this? You said in prev. yrs project output could be slightly off but this year it 
must exactly match. Also I disagree with the above post, its always been about the programming.

As always, try both ways out. The stack is simply determined by where the TOS is so if 
there are still values below the TOS they don't matter as it won't collide with the 
program

I am getting many emails from students who do not understand what they
are expected to do in this project. Actually Chris has explained it
in details, with utmost care to be unambiguous. Still I feel I need
to explain.

***The aim of the project is to write an interpreter that will execute a
program written in cool machine language. A sample code has been provided
that you have to complete.

These are the steps:

Step 1. You write a 'program' in cool language (or use one provided)
Step 2. You 'compile' it using the web server and get back a cool machine language program. 
Step 3. You use your C code to execute this cool machine language program and collect some memory usage statistics. 

All the details are given in the project specification and you should give
it a try to understand the specification. Understanding long technical
descriptions too is a requirement for this project.

answer *I would* give: 

you must write 4 different programs, 2 without a cache and 2 with the cache and 
submit them all

answer *another student* would give: 

you just need to submit one, with a cache and either using standard jeq or fast 
jeq

answer *Dr. McDonald* would give: 

you know the project requires you to write a cache? and the jeq issue is 
mentioned in project clarifications. reading before posting makes the forum 
experience a lot better

Can we add other libraries to our code? I would love to use math.h but
I have a feeling because it needs to be linked on compile that this
won't be permitted? I also want to catch some exceptions which requires
another library as well but it does not need to be linked on compile,
is this acceptable?

hii,

just wanna confirm few things that word goes into cache-memory if it is less that 32 
(2^5) words.


so we will calculate the len of the word if it is less then 32 words it will go to 
cache memory and if it is more than it goes main-memory .

is I am right or on wrong direction .

please let ne know.

thanks.

Hello Chris/Amitava or anybody else,

Does the output produced from the program written by us have to be the exact numbers 
as the numbers in the sample solution in the section "sample solution with fast-jeq 
and write-back cache"?? Because I am getting some of them to be higher or lower than 
what is given in the sample solution, or sometimes they are being the exact same, so 
could you explain what is the expectation here?

Hi Thomas,

Yes, the webpage and sample solution have changed a number of times (together). The webpage 
reports its compilation date in its footer.

Other than some cosmetic changes, and the ability to display a program's standard-output,
the primary reason for change is listed in the Clarifications (10th Sept).

I suggest that you review the Workshop discussing using a stack to evaluate arithmetic.

Replacing an item already on the stack with 0 does not remove it from the stack, it merely changes 
its value.  Moreover, it's not meaningful to speak of (any) memory location not having a value, as 
any bit-pattern, including the all-zeroes pattern of the integer zero, has a meaning when 
interpreted in some context.

There is nothing beyond the TOS, so items can be (virtually, not physically) removed from the 
stack by just adjusting the location pointed to by SP.  If any instruction requires/uses/consumes 
an item (address or integer) that has bene left, for it, on the TOS, that value must always be 
removed.  If not removed, a loop in your program will result in the stack growing and growing, 
with no guaranteed chance of cleaning it up.

Firstly, header files are not libraries - suggest that you review the relationship between 
the two.

The project description clearly states "You may use any functions from the standard C11 
library but must not employ any 3rd-party code or libraries to complete your project."

The C11 maths library is part of the standard. So, yes, OK.

However, I'm wondering what you require from the maths library for this project
(can post your answer if you like). ?

Also, note that C11 doesn't support exceptions (as does Java or C++), but you may be using 
the term incorrectly.

Sorry, but I cannot comprehend what you're asking.

Strongly suggest that you re-read the project description, and consult one of the recommended

It's that I appreciate/understand Jean-Pierre's sentiment that he would have valued clearer information earlier.

I'm not sure about CLion specifically either, but you might need to add a so-called "watch" on the main_memory variable to tell its debugger to monitor it for you. That's the sort of workflow I've seen in other IDEs I've used. Consider searching around for "watch variable clion" or similar.

Hello Chris,

I just read it and so from my understanding, if I want to know how correct is my 
program, then I compare it with the sample solution and as long as I don't get a 
zero for one of the stats or it is not widely different from the sample solution 
itself, then our program is doing good?

Firstly thanks for the last clarification, was frustrated that we weren't getting 
the exact results.

Next, since we are implementing what we think is correct, does it mean that 
solutions more complex than the sample will not be marked wrong? eg the inclusion of 
a valid bit or a flush-cache function that force any dirty bits to be written to the 
RAM. 

Or would the 'correctness' of our program be also looked at from the point of view 
of actually implementing it into a cache, considering the possible cost involved as 
well?

PS: by the way for the top part of the program, the only thing we aren't allowed to edit 
are the variables right? For stylistic reasons can we make major edits with comments?

Because sometimes I am not even getting any of the stats exactly matched but only 
close enough...and sometimes are quite different. For example, I am getting half (or 
even less) for the "number of memory writes" of what the sample solution is giving and 
almost a little bit less than double for the "number of memory misses" of the sample 
solution, but usually the "number of memory reads" is exactly the same and "number of 
memory hits is usually slightly more by a couple of hits...so since you mentioned in 
the updated clarification that we shouldn't be aiming at producing the exact sample 
solution stats but rather our program will be marked on "correctness", so does that 
mean it would be fine even if I don't get any of the stats (whether for basic or 
complex codes) exactly but only close enough (or sometimes even far enough) as long as 
my program being correct?

I'm just not sure how to split the numbers.
For example in factorial.coolexe 25441 holds the characters 'a' & 'c'. However 
converting it to a character just gets 'a' and I can see that 25443 = 'c'. So is there 
a way to split 25441 or does it need to be converted to binary and then split?

If a function doesn't have an explicit return statement, then an implicit one is added (otherwise 
the program will just continue 'beyond' the function until it hits a Halt instruction.

The function then returns with whatever value is on the TOS (after any local variables and 
parameters have been popped-off (removed), so the value from your last arithmetic calculation will 
no longer be on the TOS.

(ideally, it should be a syntax error to not have a return statement at the end of an 'int' 
function, but our parser doesn't build a tree, and so cannot determine if, say, both true and false 
branches of an 'if' have a return statement).

Error handling with files, in C11, is provided by checking the return values of functions that open and read from the file,
not from the approach taken by exceptions - 'just do it and see if anything breaks'.

Still can't imagine why you'd want/need an exponential function for this project.
Moreover, our cool language doesn't support floating-point numbers, which are required by the maths library's exp() function.

There will concern if your program runs slowly because of a poor approach, but not because 
you're running it on slow hardware.
All projects will be tested/marked on the same hardware, and compiled without any optimization.

But 60seconds does sound *very* slow.

(not wishing to turn this thread into any form of contest-against-the-wall, but on my new shiny 
Mac-M1 at home, ackermann-deep runs in 3.2secs without emulating any cache, and 7.8secs with 
cache - demonstrating that you can't correctly emulate and measure hardware in software without 
knowledge of the actual speeds of the hardware components).

As has been shown, there's many versions of 'correct', but each will produce the same 
computational snd 'print'ed results, and use the cache to minimise accesses to main-memory.
As for all projects, you'll implement what you believe to be correct (but that doesn't 
guarantee that it is).  Can't imagine why you'd implement a flush-cache feature on a single-
CPU, no-disk system??

But you may be overthinking it,  for which there's no extra marks
(but if you're experimenting with things because you're enjoying it, then I wish there were 
additional marks :-)

Even with a working cache, it's possible to make bad design or implementation decisions 
(looping over all cache locations, for example, to find the required one).

Yes, add comments anywhere that you believe it will assist readability.

Yes, lldb (and many others) do, but it's unsurprising that it considerably slows down the execution - between every instruction (theoretically,
say, every billionth of a second, the debugger has to scan through a list of watched variables to see if any of them have changed.
Slowdown of 100x wouldn't be unusual - back to a 10MHz processor!

That is exactly what the Clarification states,  though values that are double those of the 
*sample solution* may require inspection - for example, a project could be implementing 
everything 'correctly', but have simply missed a  ++metric;  somewhere.

I'm running out of ways to state this same point.

The character datatype in C11 is only 8-bits wide, so it can store values in the range 0..255  
(2^8 - 1).  You cannot 'convert' the (larger) integer 25441 into a small integer with only 8-
bits - clearly some of the information must be thrown away.

The way to split it (to extract both characters) is described in this thread.


(It makes no sense to ask if something needs converting to binary - everything the computer 
stores is in binary.  There is no other format to convert it from).

It's an interesting question, you must have been reading widely, but one that doesn't make much 
sense (have a more-correct answer in the context of our project):

- our project doesn't employ multi-word cache lines.
- our programs will not be dominated by I/O.
- we (cannot) focus on referential locality, and have no branch prediction that could dynamically 
inform the cache.
- our memory hierarchy is dominated by the stack (reflected in main-memory) and not general-purpose

Hi, 


I wrote some of my own cool programs to test my runcool but ran into some problems. 
I noticed that the order of aritmetic is always div, mult, add, sub. Is this how 
the cool program should run? If so then could you please explain where the -3 comes 
from?

Also is it correct to assume that the final return value that is at TOS will always 
be a IWORD value and never a address. i.e. ALWAYS casting read_memory(SP) to IWORD 
for final return value. 

complexneg.cool

int complexneg(int a, int b, int c, int d)
{
	int x;
	
	x = a * b / c - d + c;
}

int main(void)
{
	return complexneg(3, 6 , 2 , 20);
}


**expected -9 as output but got -3 for both sample sol and my runcool. 
I've also attached the complexneg.cool

Thank you in advanced,

Dear professors

I have a question about "return" in the project:

Why are there other instructions after the "return instruction"? If the instruction 
after the "return" needs to be executed, then the "value" of PC cannot be updated to 
the "return address" immediately. Therefore, when should the "value" of PC should be 
updated to the "return address"?

And Some functions do not require parameters, then their return value will be copied 
to the "return address" position. From this point of view, I believe that when we 
encounter a "return instruction", we should immediately update the "value" of PC to 
the "return address".

Thanks a lot:)

Well, then that's the thing Chris, I am still not sure what's the point of all these files and 
sample solutions that you have uploaded if our program can deviate from them as there are many 
ways to write a program? I mean I have written the program and "believe/think" that it is correct 
because I am testing the program and it is running and doing everything correctly but producing 
some different stats and you are saying that's fine, but I am pretty sure once you mark it then I 
will be losing marks somewhere, so what's the "ACTUAL" best way to test our programs to actually 
know where are we going wrong, even when it is running fine (but producing some different 
result)?
sorry if this question has been redundant but I just still don't get it.

So for ackermann.coolexe, im getting 1 extra reads than the sample soln. At first i 
thought it was because i had an extra read_memory() somewhere, but I compared with my 
friend (who managed to matched the sample soln) the total number of read_memory() he 
has in his program and it matches mine. So then i checked the number of instructions 
and it matches the sample soln. So I'm confused on what could be the problem. (just a

Hi Chris,

I am doing the fast-jeq with cache and I managed to get all statistics to match the 
sample except for the main memory writes. I know that my program doesn't have to 
exactly match the sample, but I am a little concerned because mine always reported 
slightly higher writes than the sample, including basic.coolexe which had 10 writes 
instead of 7. So, I did some thinking for where the extra writes might come from and 
realized that once I am outside a function, the values that only exist inside the 
function are no longer relevant. Based on this, I updated my code. The basic.coolexe 
still reports 10 writes, but larger programs managed to save quite a lot of writes. I 
now have about 30% lower writes for my ackermann-deep compared to the sample. Is this 
alright?

For the time being, I store my cache in 3 separate arrays, but I am aware that this 
might not resemble how cache works. Based on the OS textbook I read, I believe that 
our cache should have 32 lines, each with 33 bits of memory. I am not sure how to 
implement this in my program. Is my solution fine, or do I have to change it?

Thanks.

I would like to piggyback on to this main memory write problem. I have traced the stack & cache trying to figure out what the extra few writes are on each program, and have found that the program behaves exactly as I'd expect. The extra writes seems to be equal to the number of pushes.
Using basic as an example, I'll spell out my understanding and hopefully someone can identify the flaw (expected 7 writes, got 10). 
- Push and 0 instructions are written to cache. +2 "warmup" values are written to main memory.
- Zero is pushed to the stack (stored in cache), +1 warmup write
- Call and 5 instructions are written to cache +2 warmup writes
- As a result of call, the return address and previous FP are pushed to the stack (stored in cache), +2 warmup writes
- Return and 1 are written to cache +2 warmup writes
- The null return value is written to the stack (stored on cache), it replaces the stored return address, which was clean, so +0 main memory writes
- The halt instruction is written to cache, +1 warmup write

The extra 3 writes appear to be the pushed 0, return address, and stored FP. But I don't see how you'd avoid these writes at all, unless maybe you had a less efficient cache tags.

Your explanation is slightly incorrect - the order of arithmetic, actually the precedence of 
the operators *is* (dir or mult) before (add or sub).  The same as nearly every other 
programming language.

The problem/error you're seeing is that it's being incorrectly parsed as right-associative, 
rather than left - so the calculations 'come out' as, say,
4 * ( 6 / 8 )  rather than  ( 4 * 6 ) / 8

I'll try to get to this today, but it shouldn't be holding up progress with your project.
Thanks for reporting it.

(as discussed here a number of times) memory (and hence the stack) holds 16-bit values, and 
when you access each element you will know (based on the instruction being executed) whether 
the item on the TOS is to be an integer or an address.

Not sure I understand your question.
If memory holds a program consisting of multiple functions, then the code for each function 
will have (at least one) RETURN instruction - the instructions for the second function will 
naturally follow the RETURN of the first function.

Your observation is correct, but it is more relevant to the code-generation of a program 
(which you don't have to implement), and not to the interpretation of the instructions that 
have already been generated (perhaps, even, by another program).
Our functions can have zero-or-more parameters, and zero-or-more local variables, and the 
frame-format and the interpretation of the RETURN instruction have to handle all possible 
cases without the 'knowledge' of how many parameters and locals there are.

I trust that you've read the other thread:  https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help2002?p=np&a=397&all=y12
(and am thus unsure why you've started another one.

You'll have 'no chance' of decoding '26144 25441 28532 26994 27745 26912 8307' so, like most problems in Computer Science,
you should break it down into multiple smaller problems, each of which is easier to solve.

- What data is generated for an empty string, "", just a single null-byte by itself ?
- What data is generated for a very short string, "a", the character 'a' followed by null-byte ?
- Then, maybe, "ab" ?

Can you see the relationship between the strings and their data?

Hi,  I'm not quite sure what changes you've made, but it sounds like you're sort of 
"cheating" if you're trying to determine what elements of memory are being used for 
(instructions or data).  The CPU and memory don't know what the memory elements are being 
used for, and wouldn't (for example) count pairs of CALL and RETURN to determine if they'd 
inside a function or not.  If the same instruction set was used by another/different 
programming language, possibly a with a different frame format, your approach may not work.

There's (an obvious) better way than using multiple arrays.
There's no requirement (actually, no ability) to implement your cache in exactly the same 
manner as hardware may.

C11, and most other programming languages, have no ability to store or access a single bit - 
the one bit of information will be stored in (at least) one byte of memory, and additional 
instructions have to be generated by the compiler to extract the embedded information.

[Not required for the project, but you could investigate C11's fields:

  https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/bit_field

not to be confused with members of a C structure].

Here's another thing  (perspective).

This is a second-year unit (yes, there are some first-year students taking the unit), and as students 
progress through their degrees, units require, and offer, more independence of thought, curiosity, 
willingness to experiment with multiple possibilities.  This is in contrast to first year units where 
the projects are very specific, identify almost every step on the way to *the* solution, and often only 
test against a finite set of pre-released test cases. This mirrors a lot of assessment practices in 
high-school, and most students are comfortable with this (even though a decreasing number of students do 
not come directly from high-school, or are from different international systems).  While novice 
programmers will still naturally have difficulty with the projects, there is virtually no requirement 
for undertaking anything beyond 1st-year project specifications.  For many students this limits their 
accumulated knowledge by the end of their degrees, as they too often believe they have 'done enough', 
whether things are being assessed, or not  (personally I think UWA maintains the 'bridging' between 
high-school and university for too long, and the too-short 3-year degrees suffer because of it).

The need and opportunity to work beyond a project's specification in 3rd year units is even greater, 
often with reward for more creative or optimised solutions,  and almost no assessment of (expected) good 
programming practices or the development of your own test cases.  I haven't been a unit-coordinator this 
year, but you can see an example of a 3rd year project specification from last year, here:

  https://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS3002/Y2020/project2020/index.php

noting that the project requirements are specified but not the exact, not any single, pathway to 
achieving them.  The result is many different, creative solutions (yes, challenging to mark).

*** If you read about write-back caches in more than one recommended textbook, you'll see that there's 
more than a single way to implement them. Like nearly everything in Computer Science (seemingly other 
than some 1st-year projects) there's many different ways to do things, and there's multiple possible 
ways to achieve the save goal.   And we've read from multiple students about their different approaches 
who have (obviously) based their implementations on textbook descriptions, and introduced questions 
beyond our project spec.  Similarly students have been writing their own test programs, beyond those 
provided on our webpage, to assist their own experimentation.

For this project there is no single solution;  this has been made quite clear in many recent 
posts/replies, and I cannot paraphrase it in yet another way. From one perspective a project is correct 
if it runs a variety of programs correctly (producing their correct answers);  from another perspective 
a better project will achieve the goal by making better use of the available programming facilities.  
The *sample solution* addresses both of these, but it's one solution, not the only solution.  Your post 
indicates that you have another different but still correct solution.

The practise of even providing a online, executable solution before a project's deadline (other than 
just releasing code after a deadline) is a relatively new practice, which sadly appears to generate many 
questions orthogonal to projects' goals (of learning), and improperly focused students' attention.


And on another comment in your post - you don't *lose* marks in assessment, you *earn* marks by 
achieving something.  Marking starts from 0, not from the maximum.

After reading this message, I have to admit, I am very likely still stuck in the same way of thinking as a 
first-year student so it's great to make me aware of that and I think this unit (in particular this project) 
has been fantastically amazing at challenging me to the core and pushing me beyond my limits in terms of 
thinking differently than from first year.

I am half way through making my cache and had a question about submitting, as I'm running 
out of time before the due date. 

If we are getting marked based on output alone, is it better to submit a cache that's 
partially working, or without a cache but a fully working main memory. Are marks awarded 
for just getting main memory reads and writes correct without cache??

Hi,

Just came back from the break and weirdly, when I upload my own cool files to the 
website the main memory reads statistic is missing, despite it being present from the 
provided examples on the website. This was not the case before the break, perhaps a 
bug in the website?

My code is halting because I_HALT = 0, and PC begins from 0 and first instruction = 
read_memory(PC); which is 0. I am unsure how to work around this.

Hi,

At the moment we've got a rudimentary solution that is correct for the most part 
with read/write statistics on basic programs but fails to produce a correct output 
on programs that involve more than one function (e.g. factorial and Ackermann). I 
suspect the reason is due to our return function (although I may well be incorrect). 

Currently, when returning, we restore PC to be the address specified in FP + 1 (the 
return address), and we restore FP to the previous FP specified in the current FP. 
However, problems arise when (trying to) restore SP values. My thinking is - please 
correct me if I'm wrong - that SP values should always be restored to the same 
location as the returned data, so that it is the new TOS of the caller's stack 
frame.

When trying to implement this, e.g. setting SP to be FP + the offset specified in 
the word following the return instruction, the factorial output looks like:
0 factorial is 0
1 factorial is 0
And the reads/writes are about 30% higher than they should be.

However, setting SP to be FP minus the offset returns interesting results:
0 factorial is 0
7 factorial is 5040
6 factorial is 720
5 factorial is 120
...

with the correct read/writes as the sample solution, but with a correct output... in 
the reverse order. Note that I wouldn't know why the latter case works, it was just 
something I was playing around with that produced... somewhat correct results. 

So this post boils down to two questions - 

1. Am I going about returning the registers correctly?
2. Despite/in lieu of that, is there another area of the code that sticks out as 
incorrect based on the information provided?

I have been combing over this project for hours trying to figure out what is wrong :
(so any help is very much appreciated!

Ok i firgured out that this is happening because my code is reading the file and believes 
theres nothing in it, i.e byte_size = 0, there is definetely not 0 bytes in the files so 
what would be causing this?

Hello Dr Chris,

Probably it's a silly question (but that's because I am in a stage of overthinking 
everything about the project and getting paranoid, so I want to confirm every single 
thing)...so my question is that when a function with int return type lacks a return 
statement, what return value is expected/should it return (e.g., basic.cool)?

Thanks

Hello James,

Two possible problems and suggestions:

- the file holding your cool program requires the suffix '.cool',  not '.txt'

- you have not downloaded a shell, but s shallscript (a file of shell commands).
Before you can execute the shsllscript, you'll need to make it executable, as 
described on 26th August the Clarifications page.

It's working for me, and no-one else is reporting it as a problem.

Each statistic must be reported on its own line, so I suspect that your program prints 
something (integer or string) which is not followed by a newline character "\n".

The returned value of a function needs copying into a location relative to the FP.
It seems that you've already modified FP before copying the RV and changing SP.

A core message in this unit is that system-calls and the functions from the 
standard-library fairly consistently return a value, either indicating their 
success or failure for a specific reason.  All programs should capture and test 
these return values, in case something goes wrong and, as we've stated in 
Workshops, *lots* of possible things can go wrong.

Are you checking the functions' return values you're calling when trying to read 
in the .coolexe file ?

If the coolc code generation needs to adds an implicit return statement it will, but 
the returned value will just be whatever is on TOS at the time.

There's no anticipated value - it will depend on what the program has previously done. 
Just add your own return statement.

The use of main-memory without a cache is trivial - hopefully you're seen that both reading 
an writing are just 2-3 lines each.  Not many marks there.

But having correct access to main memory without a cache is the recommended (nay, only) way 
to reliably implement all of the 17 instructions, for which there are many more marks.

If you have a partially working cache, hopefully it still supports correct execution of 
most of those same instructions, and only 'breaks' a limited number of things.

Generally not advised (in any programming) unless required so, yes, if not necessary 
will affect marking.

(suspecting why you're asking) if you have time, you may like to investigate C pre-

What is 'it' ?
Is a function returning 0 to indicate success,
or returning zero to indicate that that's how many things it did for you?

Check the on-computer manual entry for the function to find out what the zero 
means.

In debugging we have found that our cache misses are only off the target by the total number of required instruction reads for the program to execute.
Are the instruction reads done through the cache?
It would seem unlikely that the cache would hold such a value and on the rare occasion it does would provide way more misses than hits.

At the termination of the code should the cache be written to memory (ie any dirty values in it)?

Yes, of course.  Instructions are held in memory, and can only be fetched, by the CPU, as going through the cache.
Why do all that (expensive, slow) work mutliple times.

Rare occasions?  Review Lecture-12,  and consider what is required when a programs executes a loop thousands of times.

(as discussed) No, once the program has finished, no-one cares what its final memory contents were (and we have no disk to store final data).

From: poster077@student.uwa.edu.au
Received: from 10.4.0.14
X-smilie: none
X-img: none

3 of my statistics match for all the small programs, they diverge for the larger 
programs but stay approximately equal so I am assuming that is simply due to 
ordering of reads and writes which I don't think I will lose marks for.
But my n_main_memory_writes is significantly higher (roughly double) in every 
program. 

Also my statistics match (better) with the fast-jeq ones so I'm assuming that is the 
algorithm I am using, but I couldn't find anywhere what that algorithm actually was. 
I believe that my code represents the simplest solution without any fancy 
optimisation so I am confused. As a result I am not sure whether my code is using 
that algorithm or if I am just implementing the cache incorrectly.

According to my understanding: The n_main_memory_writes is ONLY incremented whenever 
there is a cache write-back. The write-back ONLY happens when the cache block in 
focus has a dirty tag. According to the project page this dirty tag check happens in 
the read_memory function if there is a cache miss AND in the write_memory function. 
So I have two instances of the text "n_main_memory_writes++".

I think that somewhere in my understanding above there is a mistake because using 
that logic I get a much higher value (about double) the number of writes I should 
have. I'm guessing it isn't supposed to be incremented in one of those two cases but 
I'm not sure which one because on the project page it never states in what cases the 
statistics are supposed to be incremented. So I'm assuming it is whenever a value 
from the cache is copied or written into the main memory.


My outputs (first number) versus the sample outputs fast-jeq (second number):
while.coolexe:
@number-of-main-memory-reads	12 12
@number-of-main-memory-writes	18 12 
@number-of-cache-memory-hits	5 5
@number-of-cache-memory-misses	12 12

loop.coolexe:
@number-of-main-memory-reads	432 432
@number-of-main-memory-writes	235 108
@number-of-cache-memory-hits	511 511
@number-of-cache-memory-misses	432 432

factorial.coolexe:
@number-of-main-memory-reads	616 617
@number-of-main-memory-writes	410 230
@number-of-cache-memory-hits	671 670
@number-of-cache-memory-misses	616 617

ackermann.coolexe:
@number-of-main-memory-reads	4753 4779
@number-of-main-memory-writes	5153 2852
@number-of-cache-memory-hits	10679 10653
@number-of-cache-memory-misses	4753 4779

nested_loops.coolexe:

@number-of-cache-memory-hits	2430 903
@number-of-cache-memory-misses	1467 573

My exit return is actually incorrect for nested loops but correct for all the other 
programs I tested. I'm still working on debugging this one. But I think it's 
interesting to note my output for that one had an absurdly higher main memory writes 
disproportionally higher than the error with the other statistics. Which makes me 
believe this is a separate issue which once fixed will still leave me with main 
memory writes far too high.

Thank you in advance!

I guess my question is related to the passage about the cache in the project page. 
It states that "When the CPU WRITES data words.. the cache could remember the new 
word, but not immediately copy it to main-memory.. This is termed a write-back 
policy." 

However it doesn't say this in the read section. Instead it simply says "However, if 
the required data is not available in the cache, it must first be fetched from main-
memory. This is termed a cache-miss." 

In fetching it from the main memory, the diagram says that the data must first be 
written to the cache and then to the CPU. Now if the cache had a dirty tag does this 
mean we have to apply write-back policy. 
Write-back applies when the CPU is writing to memory but does it also in the case 
above when it instead reading from memory?


I apologise for disclosing details about my design.

Echoing Chris, I'm struggling to understand your question.

The "length of the word" isn't a meaningful thing to be considering here -- all words in the machine are 16 bits long.

If you're asking whether the *address* of the word being less than 32 changes whether its cached (e.g. that only the first 32 words are cached, with the rest going to main memory) then that is not correct. Every word has a location in the cache it can occupy, and all reads and writes to *ANY* memory words go through the cache.

I've been struggling for a while to understand how to return control
back to the callers stack frame after a function has been called.

My program never progresses past the halt instruction (Boot segment),
so the return instruction is never called. (The file opens correctly)

During the call function (apart from placing the parameters, return
address, previous FP and local vars on the stack) is there something
fundamental I'm missing when the function is called? Is the halt
instruction following the call there to change the control back to the
callers stack frame?

I know this might be due to a larger lack of understanding but I've tried
to understand the section on "Calling and returning from functions"
many times and can't seem to get it. Any help appreciated, professor
or students.

Here's my output for basic.cool if that helps:

pushc
call

halt
result = 0

Thanks for showing that;  I haven't seen it.  That's actually the wording from last year (when we last had 
a MST).  I think some of the wording 'rolls over' each year, and is described as 'indicative assessment'.
Will see if it can be changed.

No MST this year and, as that very page (under Required Assessments) and our unit webpage both say, our 2 
projects contribute 50% this year.

Are you setting/modifying the PC, to indicate where the next instruction (main's 1st 
instruction) comes from?

The HALT is there to stop the whole program, once control has returned from main().

Hello Chris,

I'm using helper functions to push to the TOS, pop items from the TOS, skip to the next 
instruction etc. and I need to pass the register pointers to the function. but if I made the 
variables global, I wouldn't need to pass any pointer since it will be available in that 
function scope.

However, I trust your judgement and I will avoid using global variables, it's just that every 
time I use these helper functions I have to add the register pointer which gets kind of 
repetitive even though that these variables will be only used in one function and in one that 
will run only once. I'm new to C and this might be the norm so I will leave it as is.

The problem with global variables is that *any* function that can see them, can possibly 
accidentally modify them.

Not just my judgement; that of millions of far better programmers than me, over the past 60 years.

It's not really "a C thing", more a "Software Engineering thing"; global variables are not 
favoured in any programming language (other than ones which can't pass parameters on a stack!)

C pre-processor macros can provide a more elegant, and easier to read, solution, but don't go 
breaking things at this stage.

Good luck,

Perhaps think of it as "if a cache memory location is modified, then the previous value 
in that location may first need to be written back to main memory".

Other than on program termination, we can't afford to lose knowledge that any value has 
changed, in case we need to get the (new, updated) value again.

Hi,

I'm attempting to implement cache and I'm not sure what the best course of action is 
to implement cache. My understanding is it would need to be an array, holding each 
word (data) previously used up to 32. However, I am lost as to how to allow for each 
word to be linked to an unknown amount of addresses in main memory. Would this require 
the use of pointers to create a dynamically growing array?

Pointers definitely not required.
The 1st project is designed so that it can be successfully coded with all the 'tools' presented 
by date of the project's release.

If unsure about how to start, or how to have multiple main memory locations associated with 
each cache location, the relevant chapter from a textbook will be your best resource.

Hi,
I think I maybe misunderstanding the write back policy. If i write a value, I can 
write it straight to the cache and mark the address as dirty.

When do I have to write it back to the main memory? Is it only when I read/write 
another value from a different address onto the same location? 

In that case for some basic operations I am getting near 0 writes to main memory 
because most of the operation is executed within the cache. Do I need to write back 
all the dirty values in the cache when I finish the program? Or do I need to utilise a 
stack somehow to write the dirty data at some interval? 

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!

So to confirm, if we have all instructions working without cache, however, are struggling to

Hi Chris,

Read through a few textbooks topics on cache and while it helped give an understanding 
of differing types of cache, their inner-workings and real world application, it's a 
struggle to convert the bloated wall of texts that dive into much more complex 
implementations into what is required for the project and the right approach to take. 
So I come back to you in these desperate times...

Are cache hits and misses determined by a matching address or data? 

My original understanding was the data however, we wouldnt be able to tell what is a 
hit or isn't without comparing the data in the cache with main_memory which would mean 
a miss every time and makes the use of cache irrelevant.

So then my second approach was the determine a hit with the given address, thus hits 
occur not only when the same data is repeated from another address, but only direct 
repeats of the same data from the same address. However, this is not producing 
expected results, statistics differ and the use of the cache is rare as the arithmetic 
used to determine the mirrored "cache block" determined from the address means 
addresses from SP and PC often conflict resulting in constant overwriting in the 
cache_blocks.

As you can see I'm running out of ideas, any help would be appreciated

Hi,

Was there any update to your nestedloops problem? We seem to be facing something similar. 
Ours exits such that the first line in the loop begins:
1 0 1
0 0 2
0 0 3
0 0 4
0 1 1 
... etc
But we're not sure what's causing this problem. Is this something similar to what you 
had? We know it is something to do with our cache implementation, though, as running the 
program with no write-back cache yields correct and expected results.

If a cache location needs to be used to hold a new value, and its current value is not 
currently reflected in main-memory, then the current values needs to be written-back.
 
 
> In that case for some basic operations I am getting near 0 writes to main memory

If your program is very small, its instructions and data total 32 words, or less, then 
you'll not see many writes to main-memory.

Your question is too difficult to answer definitively.
You receive marks, for implemented instructions and cache, both by manual inspection and 
running against some tests (automatically), so you can earn marks for things that don't 
completely work.

Indeed, it can be. The description is unlikely to be bloated (in a textbook), it'll be 
relevant (for what's it's describing), just a lot of it.
Textbooks really are great; sadly the desire to find quick solutions from only on the 
first page of a Google search often means that a lot of important detail can be lost.

 
> Are cache hits and misses determined by a matching address or data?

It's always based on addresses.
It makes no sense to know/remember which main-memory locations all have the data value 
of, say, 3, and then update them if their corresponding cache location now holds the 
value 4.

No (you earn marks, not lose them).
For C programmers, reading C code, it's very clear what's going on.
The only 'danger' that may arise is if the read_memory() function, itself, accesses PC.

Suggest that you check the proj. description again.
Cache misses occur on reads, not writes.

(now I'm confused, perhaps by your wording...)
By *data* do you mean:

- the *numeric value* of a data item, or
- the memory address that just happens to be storing data ??

The mapping to and from cache locations <-> main-memory locations is always performed based on the 
address being read or written,  never based on the value (or data of an address) being stored in one 
of those locations.

By data I was referring to the numeric values held by the addresses. However, this still raises the question on

It's always the addresses, never the numeric values held in any addresses.

Instructions like CALL and RETURN involve/manipulate the stack (which is in memory) and if CALL pushes something onto 
the stack, and it's still there when you RETURN, you'll get a hit.

I don't have this problem with factorial so I don't think it is because of recursion. 
I've been told (from lab sessions) that it could be because it has two parameters and

This is not a definitive answer, not designed to be exactly replicated, but
if you have functions like read_memory() and write_memory(), have them print out what they're accessing.

For the whole execution of basic.cool I see:

READ    0
READ    1
WRITE   65535
READ    2
READ    3
WRITE   65534

Politely, if you can't determine the problem when examining the code,
it's difficult for anyone to do better without examining the code

Yes; the intended destination is *relative* to the FP.

Also, for the return one, we also should copy the value at TOS to the destination is relative to the FP. Is that right ?

Just to expand this question.

If all locations are initialised dirty, and the process for dirty locations is to write-back 
the current value to memory and replace the current value in the cache location with the new 
value. During the initialisation (first entry for each location) stage, wouldn't the current 
value of the location be empty/nonsense, so a special case would have to be written as to not 
write the current (empty) value back to main memory?

I have a hard time figuring out to how store a word's
memory address when in cache memory. it was specified here
(https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help2002?p=np&a=432&all=y25) that
"the RAM address is being mirrored" form which I assume there is a method
to somehow have a cache location/address mirror multiple (not adjacent?)
locations/addresses in main memory.

It's possible there is a mathematical expression for this but I'm having too much 
difficulty trying to figure it out beyond 65536/32 = 2048

Part of me just wants to just use a 2d array to store the main memory address itself 
but I'm pretty sure if that's not what the project is wanting me to do.

Any suggestions to put my thinking on the right path?

That's correct;  so you'd have to careful that, if you write it 'back' to main memory, that you 
write it somewhere that wouldn't result in any future actions being incorrect (i.e. will not do 
any damage).

One possibility would be to have a per-location tag to test your condition, but to have such a 
tag that's only required once but would be tested every time, would be very inefficient.

Very close.
Imagine that you have 100 main-memory locations, but just 10 cache locations, so that 
every 10th main location has to be mapped to the same cache location:

  (0, 10, 20...) -> 0
  (1, 11, 21...) -> 1
   ....

See any pattern there?

Oh, I see how you can use maths to get a cache address from a main memory address, but I 
don't see how you can get main memory address from cache address which you will need to 
update main memory when you do a write-back. 1 cache memory location can point to 2048 
different locations in main memory but I'm not sure how you would use the cache address to 
to specify which main memory address the current data it is storing belongs to.

Am I just bad at math? Or do I need to store the actual main address whenever I do a write 
to cache memory via using something like a 2d array to represent cache memory?

also 0 (operation I'm using) non-zero integer is invalid and makes one area of the cache 
memory inaccessible (if I were to use the mathematical expression) so it would make a 
special case right?

One is a many-to-one-mapping;  the other is a one-to-many-mapping.

Don't quite understand what you're trying here, but address zero is the address at which your whole 
program starts running,  so it needs to be a valid address.

Would you rather a program that runs slightly faster (0.03s faster in ackermann deep) but writes back 
ALL dirty locations to memory (including the initial 'empty' locations for the cache addresses and 
values) or a program that doesn't writeback these initial empty locations by always checking if the 
cache address is equal to the value that all the addresses for the cache were initialised at. Both 
versions work but the former usually has ~10-20 more memory writes.
Thanks

Wouldn't the safest course just be to not write it back??? if it's useless what is the point of

We have not been focusing on speed at all in this project. And here's why:

It is false economy to worry about about 10-20 writes to memory, in a program that makes billions of memory 
accesses.

Neither you nor I (or the project) are measuring the true cost of anything - all we are measuring/counting is 
the number of reads and writes made to/from cache- and main- memory in the knowledge that main memory is 
significantly slower than cache memory (without know that true ratio), and that cache is much more costly.  
We're really focusing on the ratio of these counts, not their precise values, and certainly shouldn't be 
valuing 
a saving of just 10-20 of them.

In addition, it sounds like you're asking "is it OK to use additional housekeeping data/tags/bits to achieve 
these improvements", without (either of us) knowing the additional costs of adding circuity or power to support 
these, nor how many additional times, at what cost, these are accessed.

For example, if you were supporting a tag to record whether a cache location is being used for the first time, 
but checking that tag for *every* read or write operation has a real cost (that we don't know).  In your C 
program, you've just added an extra field to a structure, and a few extra lines of code to test/update its 
value, but are believing that those additions have zero cost.  But what if the project were asking you to count 
the number of comparisons or jumps (changes the PC) actually made/required to perform your optimisations, to 
save just 10-20 memory operations?  It would be quite a different focus!

I'm not suggesting that your question is silly, but am stating that we cannot answer it because we are not 
measuring all things needed to come to the best decision.

If you review the lecture and textbook material of Locality of Reference (and, not covered in this unit, 
Instruction Pipelining) these (unknown to us) costs are very significant, and compilers and hardware designers 
will work differently to address them.  In our project we've only supported what's called single line caches 
(unrealistic in practice) where a cache-miss results in just a single word being read from main-memory.  In 
reality a cache-miss would result in reading a 'line' of 16-64 words adjacent to the required one so that 
they're already available in cache because they'll be very likely to be required next.  Think of this as the 
memory hierarchy saying "I need the next instruction from memory and, because I'll likely need the tens of 
following instructions next, give me 16-64 words from main-memory now".  Great, we've made a prediction and 
read in many more words, but now what happens when just one of those words is modified?  Is its whole cache-
line now  dirty?  When you know and worry about these things (because speed and costs are genuinely important) 
you think about what's happening in a very different way.

Irrelevant to us on a daily basis?  No.
We see this at a much different scale (millions of times different) in our contemporary web-browsers.  You'll 
find a setting in your browser to pre-load other webpages (other URLs) from the page you're currently reading.  
If, as we all do, you use a search engine to deliver a page of results, the browser will pre-fetch the top 
result's URL *while you're reading the results' page* because there's a high likelihood that you'll next click 
on the first link.  Same principle as pre-fetching your program's instructions.  But if don't click on that top 
URL, or your program jumps to somewhere else rather than just executing top-to-bottom (causing an instruction 
pipeline stall), then your prediction failed, and you've wasted effort trying to predict things.


(it's not all Python programs out there,  there's fun stuff as well!)

As you've stated, you're observing these zero writes on very small (unrealistic) programs 
that all fit in cache and perform few, if any, memory updated without looping.  Won't

Hi Chris, 

(My code has the cache implemented, we are getting results for each value)

I know that we are not meant to get the exact values shown in the sample solutions,
however there are cases where my statistics for the solutions of the simple questions (basic, loop, if)etc are all out very slightly, maybe 3-15 max, some are even exact.

However for the larger programs, it could be 100s (factorial) or even I think 5000 (for ackermann-deep). 

I am wondering if there is a window/range we could know is acceptable for the larger and smaller programs to know how much further we need to tweak our code.

Thank you

Hi Chris,

I still can't see any relationship between the strings and their data.

For example:
 - "ab" gives 25185 and 0
 - I guess I can extract the 'a' by changing 25185 to a character:   char ch = (char)25185;
 - But I'm not sure what to do to 25185 to extract the 'b'.
 - From the other threads it seems like we are supposed split the number with the modulo operator but I've tried splitting it up 
   and rearranging it in every way I can think of but it doesn't produce 'b'.

 Any hints on what I'm missing please?

thanks for the link but the problem is not with the print statement or the syntax. It is to 
do with the include statements at the beginning of the code. I am unable to compile even 
the original file past line 1 of the code, as the '#' isn't recognized by the compiler. The 
error message was:
error int or void expected, found '#'
this error is not one that can be related to the sample files as there are no include 
statements in them. Could you please explain what is wrong with lines such as:
# include <stdio.h>

Your on the right track by looking at the data that is associated with a string. Try compile a word and then see how much data the compiler 
makes to print it. How many memory positions are generated for x number of letters? and then think about the projects definition of what 
each memory slots size is, might reveal something on the data size of characters.

Hello Cooper,

You do not upload your C program (with suffix .c) to the webpage.
You upload your cool programs (with suffix .cool), and then download coolexe files.

You develop, compile, and test your runcool.c program on your own computer.

I suggest that you review the project description webpage.

Hello Joseph,

Before trying "ab",  did you first try the empty string "",  and then "a", to see how their data representation 'evolves' as the 
related strings get longer?

An update on the 1st project, as some students are asking about some of these matters. 

To date (still some students with approved extensions) we have 173
project submissions, of which 87 were from students working in pairs.

(as is typical) about 15% were submitted late, but this is overlooked if
you submitted just a few minutes late. 14 submissions did not compile,
and I've now contacted all of those students.

[There has been a small problem identified with a handful of submissions
that employed nested functions. C11 does not support nested functions but,
unfortunately, gcc on Linux accepts them, even if -std=c11 is specified.
(Typical of) GNU software to defy standards by 'throwing in' some
extra helpful options, even if not requested, and difficult to remove
(need -pedantic).  No such problems with clang.  As the project spec. did
not require you to use -pedantic, we'll ignore this matter in compiling
and marking.  Fixed for Project-2!]

We'll get a well commented sample solution to you all as soon as the
last anticipated project is submitted.

Good luck,

Hi,  I'm a little confused by what your question is asking.

If you have implemented reading and writing using a cache, you only need to 
increment integer variables to count the hits and misses.

In the starting code:
  https://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/projects/runcool.c
the function  report_statistics()  outputs their values at the termination of the 
program.

Hi,

I'm afraid that I still don't know what the problem is that you're facing;  just sounds 
like "everything to do with caches".

There are, of course, many discussions on here about caches (in fact most, as it's the 
biggest challenge of the project).  But before asking their questions most students have 
read the relevant section from a good textbook, or online tutorial, tried to implement 
something, and then asked questions about their understanding or implementation.

Not sure how far along that sequence of learning about caches you are.

Hi Chris,

The cache I implemented matches the solution stats completely except my number-of-main-memory-
writes is always slightly too high. I can't figure out why.

My understanding is that number-of-main-memory-writes is incremented iff:
 1. In the case of a read-request: if the cache is marked dirty and the requested address does 
    not match the cache address. The cache info must be written to memory, and the requested 
    info fetched from memory and stored in cache.

 2. In the case of a write-request: if the cache is marked dirty and the requested address does 
    not match the cache address. The cache info must be written to memory, and the new info 
    written into the cache.

Is this incorrect? Thanks.

There's a number of posts, and the Clarification of 10th Sept, that states why getting the 
identical statistics is not essential.

Yes, both of those are correct;  you'll also need to set/reset the dirty bit, else you may be 
unnecessarily writing to main-memory.

Hi, I was wondering, that since we are implementing
a write-back cache. Is the data only written to main memory
when there is a read request for data which is not in cache?
Therefore having to write the data in the cache into main memory
to free up cache memory. 

When calling write_memory do we ever actually need to write into 
main memory, or is it all just written into cache?

Thanks in advance :)

This is really a 'big' question that has been well discussed in this forum, and you 
should be consulting past discussions and (more importantly) a textbook on the topic.

(firstly, congratulations on not asking a Project question! :-)


It's not guaranteed, but I'm guessing that you're calling the function with:

  strcat_a(argv[1], argv[2]);
???

If so, you need to look at how much memory (its length) is being passed for dest[]

Compile and run this code:

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
	if(argc > 2) {
	    char *addr;

	    addr    = argv[1];
	    printf("1: %p\t%li\t%s\n", addr, (long)addr, addr);
	    addr    = argv[2];
	    printf("2: %p\t%li\t%s\n", addr, (long)addr, addr);
	}
	return 0;
    }

Your output will be different, but I see:

./try hello world
1: 0x16f78f76c  6165165932      hello
2: 0x16f78f772  6165165938      world

Here, the address of argv[2] is only 6 bytes beyond argv[1] - easy to see why.

So when you attempt to append something to argv[1], as only 6 bytes are reserved for 
it (before we 'bang into' argv[2]),  then any characters beyond that 6 will simply 
overwrite the memory beyond argv[1].  And guess what's there?  argv[2].

So, that's (probably) why you're observing that src[] is being modified.

(P.S. it's generally a bad practice to modify anything in argv[] )

Hello Chris,

I hope you are doing well. 

1-) Can you explain Makefile a little bit more, how to go about constructing it and 
what is it exactly? Because I am not sure if I still 100% understand what is it and 
how to implement it?

2-) For me, testing my code is more daunting than writing the code itself, so how 
would you go about testing the code for this project? What's your advice on this?

3-) Would there be any more updates/clarifications coming about the project? Or is 
this the final version of it?

Hello Ninmar,

To avoid me first paraphrasing a lot of existing material, may I ask if you've downloaded 
and tried the 'make' example from Lecture-17 and, if still unclear, what about it is still 
unclear?

There's whole books of advice, and good practice, on this topic, so my advice will be very 
incomplete.  As you consider each step or stage of the project, make sure that you know 
what that stage does, what it adds to the whole project,  and only attempt that single 
stage at a time, not moving on the the next stage until you're confident that it works.  
We've partially been using this approach in Workshops - make a small change, compile the 
program, fix any syntax errors, run the program to see if the most recent change has 
'advanced' the program being developed, or if the change has introduced a problem.

There's a solid body of Software-Engineering work, termed Test-Driven-Development (TDD), 
that suggests that you design/identify the tests *first* - before you write the code - 
and, at the extreme, you only write code that is focussed on passing the tests.  Do not 
write anything beyond what passing-the-test requires, anything else is not needed (and 
you're possibly not being paid the the extra features).  I'm not sure that this TDD 
approach works completely for this project, but knowing what needs to be tested, by first 
designing the tests, then writing the code that enables those tests to be performed, does 
make sense.


> 3-) Would there be any more updates/clarifications coming about the project? Or is

Clarifications are made when something is unclear, perhaps ambiguous - they're not planned 
ahead of time!  There's no planned additions (or deletions) planned for the project.
At this stage, what do you think is missing?

Got a similar question so I'll post it in this thread to not flood the forum:

When multiple valid options are given, which ones are given priority of execution and which ones 
terminate? (of course not referring to -a)

eg ./program -a -l -h -f -q <directory>

-f, -q, and -h were explicitly stated to terminate after serving their function, so they can't 
all execute. In that case which one will be executed? The option that comes first?

-l was stated to terminate in the Getting started section, but not in the initial program 
invocation section. I'm assuming it also exit(EXIT_SUCCESS) on finish?

Hi Chris,

In the assignment 2 brief it states that POSIX functions such as strdup() are expected to 
be used. I was having trouble getting my code to compile, due the strdup() function being 
present, no matter what I #include(d) or #define(d). I am using the ubuntu distro that we 
set up in the docker container at the beginning of semester for reference.

I managed to get it to compile by adding -D_GNU_SOURCE as a flag in my makefile. I just 
wanted to make sure that this would not cause any compilation issues when it comes too 
marking.

Thanks in advance.

Hi Alvaro,

For some of the combinations, there'll be an execution sequence that 'are logical' in the 
context of what the options request, and for other combinations there'll be no logical 
sequence - there'll just be the one that's implemented.  There's many examples across the 
standard utilities where the execution sequence is not even stated in the online 
documentation,  but is 'revealed' by trying combinations of options (or even looking at the 
source-code, if it's available).

Most students won't care about these pragmatic issues, as their focus will just be on how 
their projects will be marked.  So we can just make an almost arbitrary decision as to what 
is the 'correct' way.  So, let's define things as:

- if there's a contradiction or overlap in the actions amongst the requested options, execute 
the first requested option in alphabetic order - for example, if both -f and -h is requested, 
perform the -f option and then exit.

- this won't be tested during marking;  each option will be tested independently of others 
whose actions contradict or overlap.


__
The phrase “we’re unconcerned about the files’ names or their modifications times” means 
that, when determining if two or more files are identical, we don't care if they have the 
same name, or the same modification time - we just care about their hashes.

I think my previous answer now answers your question.

Note that, in your example, you're requesting files with a hash value of "-f"  (which is probably 
not what you're wanting).

Your project will be compiled using your submitted Makefile, so your approach will work.

The question of *how* to declare strdup() is a good (and common) question, for which there's truely correct or portable 
answer.  Your solution relies on the knowledge that the C preprocessor token _GNU_SOURCE 'reveals' the declaration in 
some header file,  but strdup() is not really a GNU 'thing',  it's just that GNU developers have chosen to provide the 
declaration (on their terms).  We see similar things from Apple, BSD, POSIX, ....  and specific pre-processor tokens are 
defined, by default, in different compilers on different platforms.

strdup() is actually *defined* by the POSIX and XOPEN standards groups, and is *not defined* by particular distributions 
(just *within* them).  So using a POSIX based pre-prcoessor token should provide the most portable solution.

In recent labsheet and workshop solutions I've been adding:

   #if     defined(__linux__)
   extern  char    *strdup(const char *string);
   #endif

which works on Linux, without confusing students on Macs or Windows.

It looks like, either:

- you do not have a C file that defines the main() function, or
- you're not compiling or linking that file into your executable.


Also, note that this project requires you to use the  -pedantic  compilation option.

Yes, the directory entries dot and dot-dot were discussed in Workshop-8,
and dealing with them correctly is an important responsibility of your project.

Although it's stated that a directory will be given as an argument, in the scenarios 
that it's not given, should we examine the current directory by default? ie "./"

Will any sample solutions and sample directories be provided like with project 1?

Also just in case I'm going off track, is it normal for my program to take 2-3 seconds 
to finish (with no options) when examining a directory containing 6 images each ~700 
to 900KB each? I'm not sure what file type will be tested against and unsure if my 
program is too slow.

Thanks in advance!

Yes, that's what they're provided for  (and don't forget lab solutions).

If not concerned with efficiency (which we're not), for most of those code segments 
there's no significantly better or simpler way to write such frequently seen 
sequences   (modesty aside :-)

The code of a sample solution after the deadline.
If I have time this week (and that's a big IF) I'll write a webpage that allows you to 
upload a directory of files (as a Zip file), and it'll run the sample solution on that 
directory.  But it's a busy week for me.

That sounds a bit slow for just 5MB, but it'll depend on your available computing 
resources.  You should notice that most time is been spent in the strSHA2() function, 
not your code.

The execution speed of the SHA2 algorithm is linear in the length of its inputs.

Oh, actually it is a bit faster than I thought. I increased the total file size to 11MB and it
