FIRSTLY, if you read nothing else, please read this section.

Our unit this year has a record enrolment - 401 students, up from 320 last
year.  Our lecture theatre holds 340, so it'll be an impossible squeeze
for the first week.  Further, we don't have sufficient lab times or spaces
for all students to be guaranteed a seat in our weekly lab sessions.

*** If you're a student who prefers to NOT ATTEND LECTURES, then this week
*** will be a great time to make that choice!   I'm confident that from
*** week-2 our venues will comfortably hold everyone who turns up.

(I'm not panicking about this and I don't think that you'll need
 to either.  In previous years I have worried about this, adding extra
 repeat lectures, only to find that the only available times and venues
 were at 5PM or 6PM;  barely 20 students attended the repeat sessions,
 and students drifted away from the original lectures anyway.)

-------

We'll spend part of the first lecture on Monday discussing how the unit
will run this year, but first I'll head off some common questions that
students are asking by email:

Firstly, we're NOT using LMS/Blackboard for this unit.
All information and teaching materials will be available from:

    http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/  -  bookmark it!

LECTURES:
    We have 2 45 minute lectures each week. All lectures will be recorded
    and available via LCS. The schedule of lecture topics, in fact all
    sessions in the unit, is available from the left-margin of the
    unit's homepage. The HTML of all lectures will be available to read or
    download ahead of time.
    Attendance at lectures is not compulsory.

WORKSHOPS:
    Most weeks we'll hold a workshop on Fridays, to review the week's
    material by focusing on the design and implementation of a short
    program addressing a single problem. You'll receive the problem
    ahead of time, hopefully sketch out a solution, and we'll discuss
    it in the Friday workshops. The workshops are in our standard lecture
    venue, not a computing lab, so you should bring your laptops along.
    Attendance at workshops is not compulsory.

LABORATORIES:
    The announced laboratory times are times at which there'll be someone
    there to assist you;  see:

        http://timetable.applications.uwa.edu.au/?selectunits=CITS2002

    Most weeks, when the two projects are not "running", will have a
    laboratory sheet of 3-4 "standard" questions, and often a couple of more
    difficult questions, for you to attempt that week.  Sample solutions to
    the standard questions will be provided.  If you can successfully complete
    the sample questions, each week, then you're keeping up in the unit.
    Attendance at laboratories is not compulsory.  Come along if you need to
    use a computer, or if you need some help with a question.  There's no
    requirement to stay the full 2 hours.  Labs are open 24/7 although,
    of course, students allocated to other units' lab sessions have priority.

I hope that you'll enjoy CITS2002 this semester.

*** NEW DEADLINE for applications: 11:59PM Sunday, 4th August.

CITS2002 is taking part in the Guild's Class Representative System for
semester 2. The system provides you a simple method to raise feedback,
suggest ideas, and resolve any potential challenges in a timely way.

The Guild is looking for applications for students in this unit to become
representatives.  Reps are trained by the Guild, and volunteering hours
will be recorded on your transcript.

As we start week 1, the semester will breeze past rapidly, so timing
is essential. In order for the system to be effective within your unit,
it'll require students to apply and be appointed as representatives. To
become a rep, students will need to register their interest via an
application online next week. Following this, 1-3 students will be
selected by the Guild.

If you are interested then please register your interest here:

I might be asking a stupid question but I can't seem to find where ROT = 13 is initialised 
and how when executing the code it is able to Cipher by 13 when input is given? I

Basically, if you give an input of something like "13 hello", your program should set the 
value of ROT as 13 because it's the first argument.

If your input is "1 hello", then ROT should be 1 instead.

There's a couple more steps:

prompt>  sudo apt update
(need to type your password)

prompt>  sudo apt install gcc
(to install gcc, its headers, and libraries)

Now the command 'cc' should work from the next prompt.

Hi Madeline,

I'm afraid that I need to provide an 'official' response to this, but it's not 
directed to you personally.

UWA discourages our lab demonstrators from directly contacting students in their 
units.  One reason is that lab demonstrators are only paid for the time they 
spend helping in labs and when marking assessments,  but the more important 
reason centres around ensuring that all students are treated equitably, and none 
receive any individual advantage.  For these reasons, our lab demonstrators (and 
me) are not permitted to undertake any private tutoring for students in their 
units.

I appreciate that your question may be a harmless one, such as "did anyone find 
my textbook that I left in the lab?",  and such questions are perfectly welcome 
on our help2002 forum (it doesn't all have to be about the teaching material).

If you, or anyone, has any more personal questions about their enrolment, or 
performance in the unit compared to other students, then please contact me by 
email, or anytime my office door's open (Rm 2.20).

Hope this helps.

Hi,

Your approach to finding the command is correct, but it's not a command available in Ubuntu 
repositories.

Instead, like our 'mycc' shell alias, it's a local command that can be added to your startup files and 
is then available each time you login.   We tend to use aliases for short single-line commands, but my 
'vc' is a multi-line command sequence termed a shell function.  Just like 'mycc' it should be added to 
your  ~/.bash_profile  file, which is read each time you login.

Add all of lines from 'function vc' to the last '}' to your ~/.bash_profile file.
Invoking 'vc' will create a new short C file named t.c, but will not overwrite an existing one.

{{{
#!/bin/bash

function vc {
if [ ! -r t.c ]
then
cat << END_OF_PROGRAM > t.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

int main(int argcount, char *argvalue[])
{

    return 0;
}
END_OF_PROGRAM
fi
vim +7 t.c
}
}}}

From: chris.mcdonald@uwa.edu.au

Hi Edward,

The primary reason is to provide consistency with the many other commands - so that we don't need to remember 
which command's options require a minus-sign, and which don't.

Consider a different example, the program to remove files, named 'rm'.
rm takes a -f switch to request that files be 'forcibly' removed - if a file can't be removed, the rm command 
attempts to change the file permissions of the file, and then tries to remove it again.
Providing -f also requests that the rm command not complain if a named file doesn't exist.

For example,       rm -f myfile
will 'successfully' delete  myfile  even if it doesn't exist.

If we had a file named 'f' in the current directory (I often do, to hold a small temporary result),
then the command   rm f myfile   would have a different, probably undesirable, outcome.

The question doesn't quite make sense.  In this unit, students are not assigned to fixed 
lab sessions, and may attend any or all lab sessions to get assistance.

However, when choosing a project partner, it certainly makes sense to choose someone that 
will be able to work on the project at similar times to yourself, and possibly attend the 
same lab session(s) if you need to.

Hope this helps,

Hi Chris,

I noticed in the last workshop you used a custom shell alias called "vc" (I think it was vc anyway) which opened a vim editor window with the boilerplate code for a C program. 

I had a go at making my own shell alias to achieve the same effect, which worked but was slightly buggy. 

I made a file called "template.c" in my home directory and then placed the following shell alias in my .bashrc file: 

alias vc="cp ~/template.c . | vim template.c"

Is there a way of improving my method? How did you do it? 

Every time I run vc on my shell I get the output:

 Warning: Input is not from terminal. 

Cheers :)

I trust that you saw my reply to an earlier question:

  https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help2002?p=np&a=18&all=y2
?

vim demands that its input comes from a keyboard, so that's why you're getting "Warning: Input is not from terminal".

However, you don't want to use the pipe symbol '|' to separate successive processes - separate them with a semi-colon ';'

You may choose to undertake each project individually, or with one other student.

Have a read of Chapter 21 of the very useful (and free):

  https://goalkicker.com/CBook/

For our (simple) programming, use %i for integers, and not %d .

You can also look at the online manual for the printf() function.
It's in Section 3 of the online manuals, so you'd run:

  man 3 printf

This problem occurs when your program accesses memory that it does not own (it's attempting 
to access memory owned by the OS, another process, or even unallocated memory).  We'll me 
discussing the what and why of this when discussing memory management in the unit.

The most common way for your code to trigger the error is for it to access beyond the bounds 
of a fixed-sized array.  If your code is attempting an exercise on our lab sheets, check your 
accesses to the argvalue[] array - ensure that you're not accessing element [argcount] or 
higher.  Similarly, if you're accessing any other array, ensure that your accesses are not 
belong [arraysize-1] or even negative.

I've mentioned in lectures a number of times that the features of programming languages are often very

provided ideas for later languages.

The following article may be of interest  (warning - it's behind the medium.com paywall, but you can 
read 5 articles a week) :

    "These are the languages which have contributed immensely to the software

     Since programming languages are the single most important thing in the

Sorry if this is too basic a response, but are you interpreting the above command correctly?
It means:

  cc -std=c99 -Wall -Werror -pedantic -o myprogram myprogram.c -lm

Oh sorry my fault I thought the [EXTRAOPTIONS] was an actual command after cc. 
The program can be perfectly compiled now.

Are you able to suggest what is lacking on this forum;  how it can be improved?

I'm concerned that valuable discussion, which all students should be
reading, becomes spread across multiple locations, and there's the danger
of incorrect information being accidentally posted and not corrected.

Nothing against students helping each other out, though; it's just that we've
seen previous cases where wrong information has been spread (within residential
college tutorials) and students' test outcomes suffered.

Discord often looks more like a Twitter exchange, than a serious forum,
but maybe some students learn better that way.

The completed solution to Workshop-3 is now posted on our Schedule page.
We didn't quite finish it in the class this morning, but were close.

You should see it report that the distance between Computer Science and the Science Library 
(as the crow flies) is about 630 metres.

You'll notice in the solution's code that a few extra lines are required under Linux (and, 
thus, under WSL) to have the C compiler find the M_PI constant in the <math.h> header file.

The command would have been just. "grep /haversine hh.c"
which finds/prints the pattern  /haversine  in the file hh.c

If you don't have a file named  hh.c,  then grep will report the file missing.

Are you running this on WSL?
I'm unsure if WSL supports foreground/background job execution in the shell.

If using a MacBook you're running macOS - iOS is on iPhones and iPads.

Can you run through that you were doing?
If you just typed 'jobs' at the prompt, it'll report nothing (just display next prompt) if 
you have no fg/bg jobs running.

If you're running, say, vim and you then suspend it with ^Z. (control-Z),
then you'll see the next prompt, and running  'jobs'. will now report

  [1]  + suspended  vim myfilename

I think one of the things that is lacking in the this forum is the ability to write 
codes or more on the documentation that allows the writing of code (i dont know how 
to write formatted codes here) unlike stackoverflow [uses indentation] , discord [use 
```js or any programming languange], github[uses ```]).

If there is a documentation to write code here, the documentation is not easy to 
find. I know its possible because of this

Thanks for your comment Frinze.

Coincidently, I've only been adding syntax highlighting to our forums in the last week, and a 
couple of our staff offered to test it.
Another example:  https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help2002?a=3

I haven't yet added some short on-screen documentation for it, and am still awaiting feedback, 
but it works (similarly) by including special tags at the beginning of lines:

 {{{
 your-code-here
 }}}

Your feedback welcome, too.

Hi
I have few questions from the lab2 practice

In Q4 solution:

bool luhn(char creditcard[])
{int s1 =0;
 .....
  char digit = credicard[I] - '0';
....
if(ood){
s1 += digit;
}
....
  int mult = digit*2;
...}
why the s1 can be added by the char type digit and
why we char the digit instead of int but int the mult which expressed by digit.I got 
confused.
Also can I use char type value in if statement for comparing(just like python), such 
as:

if( arg =='a')
{

}

Thank you

Sorry, I'm having difficulty understanding your question.
Values of type 'char' are simply small integer values, on modern systems on 8-bits long which 
limits the range of values that they may hold.
They may be added to 'int's which are simply larger integers, typically 32-bits long.

Adding an 8-bit char and a 32-bit int, will produce a 32-bit result.

Yes, conditions involving any base datatype, such as characters, integers, and float-point 
values, can be used in 'if', 'while', 'for', .....

We've seen such a comparison using characters in a 'for' loop:

It's possible to ssh into the Macs into Lab 2.03 from other (wired) machines in the CSSE building, but not yet from machines connected via Unify or the new VPN.
I have asked our Faculty-IT people to remove the firewall rules preventing access.

Each Mac has a distinct IP address, and it's best to choose a random one so as to not overburden the same Mac every time.
The following shellscript helps with this - trying each Mac, in a random order.

Place all of these shell lines in a text file on your laptop, set your student number, make the file executable (chmod +x findmac), and execute the script by name.

{{{
#!/bin/bash

STUDNO=xxxxxxxx

TIMEOUT=3       # seconds

function findmac
{
    IPfirst="114"
    IPlast="150"
    N=`expr $IPlast - $IPfirst`

    IPtry=`expr $IPfirst + $RANDOM % $N`

    for i in `seq $IPfirst $IPlast`
    do
            H="130.95.252.$IPtry"
            echo trying $STUDNO@$H
            ssh -o "ConnectTimeout $TIMEOUT" $STUDNO@$H && break
            let IPtry+=1
            if [ $IPtry -gt $IPlast ];

When trying to compile my function written during the workshop I receive multiple 
errors, each saying undefined reference to <trigfunction> (sin, cos etc). I have 
included the mat.h header and have added -lm to my command line prompt (cc -o -lm 
workshop2 filename.c) however it has not fixed the issue.

Any help would be appreciated

Try with the command:

  cc -o workshop filename.c -lm

because you've probably made an executable file named '-lm'.

If so, how are you going to remove a file named '-lm' ??

Characters are small integers, so there is no contradiction in using characters with a subtraction 
expression.  The expression on the right-hand-side of:

  char digit = credicard[I] - '0';

involves two characters, and we know (hope) that the values seen in the creditcard arrays are digits 
themselves, '0'..'9', so pleasing the result into a character is reasonable.

If we didn't know the possible values of creditcard's elements, and we feared that credicard[I] - '0'; could 
produce a negative result  (quite unmeaningful in our context), then using 'full sized' integers may be more 
defensive.

Hi all, was in the workshop today and couldn't figure at all why it wasn't running 
correctly.

Essentially the issue is that when the program runs, the while loop is being 
ignored/missed (I believe) as the it only returns the print statement that the 
password is unsafe with every variable I used (not shown but I imagine you get the 
idea).

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated :)

I think the way you're iterating over the string might not be correct.

When replicating your code I tried the following:

{{{
int i = 0;
char ch;

ch = string[i];

while(ch != '\0')
{
    // your code goes here...
    i++;
    ch = string[i];
}
}}}

You can drastically reduce your test cases by using the isalpha() function. Similarly, I found that using a bounded for loop (using strlen or my_strlen) made this exercise much less of a headache.

Hope it helps!

Hello Jack,

Your approach is correct, except for the fact that you're relying on functions such as 
isupper() to return 1 on success.  That's not the case.

The manual entry for isupper(), and the other functions, says:

RETURN VALUES
     The isupper() function returns zero if the character tests false and
     returns non-zero if the character tests true.

While the function may return 1 on some platforms, it doesn't have to; it just has to return 
a non-zero value.  Consider the code:

{{{
for(char ch=0 ; ch < 127 ; ++ch) {
    if(isalnum(ch)) {
	printf("'%c'_%i  ", ch, isupper(ch) );
    }
}
printf("\n");
}}}

When compiled and run on macOS, we get:

'0'_0  '1'_0  '2'_0  '3'_0  '4'_0  '5'_0  '6'_0  '7'_0  '8'_0  '9'_0  'A'_1  'B'_1  'C'_1

So, your innocent looking code will work on macOS, but not on Linux.
The difference is not the operating system, however, but the C libraries used by their 
compilers.

Hello,

I'm happy to help, but don't wish to simply paraphrase the whole project description.

When you've reviewed today's lecture, read some relevant material from an online tutorial

Hi;  unsure what you mean by 'contains' those 3 datatypes (presuming you're asking about 
any mixture of different datatypes?)

Are you asking about a function receiving mixed parameters, or one having local variables 
of different types?

In either case, I can't see any difficulty with these, as we've had similar examples 
before.

Hello Chris,

Yes. I am asking a function receiving mixed parameters.

In the labsheet 3, the second question is asking me to write a function to determine if a

Question 2 states that the function should receive a single character array as its argument and 
return a Boolean value,  so there's no concern about multiple parameters to the function, or having 
parameters of different types.

[Important question] Will you be working with a project partner for the first project?  If so, are 
you able to discuss these Labsheet-3 questions with them, as understanding and 'solving' them will 
certainly help in the project.

Seriously, and politely, at the level of a 2nd year unit, your question makes 'no sense'.
It reads as if you're starting from a knowledge base of zero, and that you're asking for all 
information to be provided.

So, what do you understand the project to be about, what is its goal, what are the expected 
inputs and outputs of the program - all by your understanding, after having reviewed today's 
lecture, an online tutorial, or a section from a textbook?

Next, given what you do understand, what don't you understand?

Clearly the hardest bit is "how to go from the provided input(s) to the required output?".
Do you have any thoughts about that, yet?

The C99 starting file for the 1st project is now available from:

  http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/projects/besttq.c

It accepts and checks command-line arguments, parses a tracefile
provided on the command- line, and then shows where to execute a number
of simulations/evaluations of the job-mix provided in the tracefile.
It is heavily commented, and gives hints where you will need to modify
and extend what's provided.

(That's 170 lines that you don't need to write!)

It compiles cleanly and executes on both macOS and Linux  (so if you break it, you fix it).

You can invoke the program in two ways (examples):

  ./besttq  tracefile  100  2000  50

will simulate/evaluate the job-mix several times, with time-quantum values of 100usecs, 
150usecs, 200usecs, ....  and

  ./besttq  tracefile  500

will simulate/evaluate the job-mix just once, with time-quantum = 500usecs.

Questions, via help2002, welcome.

Good luck,

Hi Jack;  glad we resolved it, in an understandable way.

Interesting, as well, to identify a simple example of something that's different between macOS and Linux or, 
at least, their standard compilers and libraries.  Developing a portable solution for both platforms isn't 
difficult, it's just all about reading their manuals!

Good luck,

The honest answer of 'as soon as I can...' isn't what you want to hear, but it's true.

You can, however, trivially make some for yourself, following their description and example 
from the project sheet,  and can use the provided besttq.c code to parse them.

From: poster087@student.uwa.edu.au

Hi Chris,

I am slightly confused by the project description. In the description it states: 

" Your program, named besttq, should accept command-line arguments providing the name of the tracefile and three integers representing times measured in microseconds."

To me this seems to imply that the three integer arguments should represent time quanta to test to find the optimum time among those arguments that were supplied.

However, on the next line it has the output:

{{{

 prompt> ./besttq  tracefile1  100  2000  100
best  1600  440800


}}} 

which says that the optimum time quanta is 1600 microseconds. 

Therefore, what is the point of the command line argument?

Hi im just having a bit of trouble understanding the concept varying the time-
quantum. As i understand, we have to change the time-quantum until we get the best 
total process completion time. Does changing the time quantum mean we change the 
time each process starts at and then see which one results in the best total 
completion run time. For example in the below picture do we make process 1 start 
at 150 and then process 2 start at 440.

Download, compile, and run the starting besttq.c code, and you'll see how those 3 integers are used (with *any* existing file):

  ./besttq. besttq.c  100 2000 100

running simulate_job_mix( time_quantum = 100 usecs )
running simulate_job_mix( time_quantum = 200 usecs )
....
running simulate_job_mix( time_quantum = 2000 usecs )

No, you just run the "whole thing" several times, with different values of the time-quantum 
(ranging over the requested value).

There is no always-perfect time-quantum, just a 'best' one (of those considered) for each job-
mix.

Hi, I'm trying to understand the tracefile on the Project Sheet:

The project sheet says process 2 commences before process 1 exits. How do I see it in 
this way? The exit of process 1 is at 400ms and the start of process 2 is at 480ms.

Process 1 starts at 200usecs after the reboot, process 2 480usecs after the reboot.
Process 1 exits after it's executed (on the CPU) for 400usecs.

If we're supposed to make these trace files manually at first, do we need to put these

So I've read the description of the trace_file function, and I see that this function 
takes a file as a parameter, and reads it line by line. I see that the lines the 
function are supposed to be stored somewhere. Correct me if I'm wrong, but do we need 
to declare arrays somewhere for these lines? I see there's some integers defined e.g. 
MAX_DEVICES and MAX_EVENTS PER_PROCESS; does that have anything to do with it?

Another thing, I've been trying to figure out was how the results of the example in 
the project page came to 1600 440800. I've been trying to calculate numbers from the 
tracefile and processes (i.e. converting seconds and microseconds, adding 
microseconds, converting bytes to seconds), but this still has me puzzled. Can someone 
please give a hint about how it gives this calculation?

Thank you

Utility and application programs "don't care" where their input files are - you typically invoke 
the program and inform the program, implicitly or explicitly, where the file is.

The OS kernel supported functions don't "go looking" for your file - you simply tell them where 
the file is   (yes, some *applications* do your files to be in special or assumed locations, but 
not our project).

For example (assuming that the filenames exist) each of these commands will work - you can test 
this by compiling and running the besttq.c starting code :

  ./besttq  myfile  100
  ./besttq  ./myfile  100
  ./besttq  ../myfile  100
  ./besttq  ~/myfile  100
  ./besttq  /the/path/to/myfile  100

Yes, you'll need to store the data somewhere, because you cannot process/run a job-mix on-the-fly 
as you read it.  The choice and design of those data structures is up to you, but arrays will be a 
good (obvious) choice.

MAX_DEVICES, etc, are not integer definitions, but preprocessor lines (directives).
But, yes, they'll be used as values to usually provide an upper-bound on the size of your chosen 
data structures.

The values of 1600 440800 are just an example of expected output, unrelated to the tracefile 
example on the project sheet.

Those command-line arguments to cc are used by that Labsheet example to compile and link with 
a simple 3rd-party GUI toolkit.  It's very unlikely to be installed, by default, on WSL,  and 
was installed specifically on our lab Macs.

I wouldn't spend too much time on it (just try it in the CSSE lab), but if you persist you'll 
be needing to install the Tcl and Tk development packages under Linux.  Historically they were 
included in standard distributions, but I'm unsure if they are today.

Once Tcl/Tk is installed on a Linux machine, you should be able to compile the
program with just    cc -o xword xword.c -ltcl -ltk

By  "all //" I'm guessing you're asking about the URL   
  http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/projects/besttq.c
??

You don't use vim, or any editor, to edit the file referenced in a URL - the file, after 
all, is on another machine and is not owned by yourself.

You download a copy of the file to your own computer, using a browser or the command

  curl -o besttq.c http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/projects/besttq.c

and then edit your own local copy.

Makes sense to me - a post with the same Subject line continues an existing thread, by design.
There's really no need for multiple threads, all with slightly different titles, all asking/responding to the same thing.

Is this project based on the concept of round robin scheduling. I was doing some 
research and this seemed very similar to it. Instead of having a fixed quantum we 
change quantum and see how that effects the total process completion time.

Okay, thanks for answering. But now I have a couple more questions about what to do. If we can use arrays 
to store data, where exactly would we declare these arrays? Can it be in the main function (Don't 
remember if the project said we're allowed to edit the headers)? And since the results provided isn't 
related to the tracefile provided, could you give an example of what the program would actually print out 
from the tracefile, if it's possible?

Thanks again.

Yes, RRS is one a few terms for the concept (there's many variants of it).

However, we keep the TQ constant for one complete run of the job-mix,
then vary the TQ and make the next complete (re-)run.

Hi Chris,

I was trying to compile the full-solution.c as you provided for our workshop. However, 
the compiler returns an error by saying tcl.h: NO such file or directory.

I tried to install the package by calling "sudo apt-get install tcl".
The package seems to be installed but the problem exists, I am not able to either 
compile or run the compiled version of the program. 

Please advise.

Thank you.

Hi, I'm trying to figure out the following question:

(11) Which of the following statements about character arrays in C is/are true?

i. Indexing starts from 1.
ii. Character arrays are always terminated by the null-type.
iii. Array elements are all of the same data type

A. i. only
B. ii. only
C. iii. only
D. None of i., ii., or iii.


Is ii false because character arrays are terminated by  the null character (\0), not a 
null-byte?

There's 2 parts to Tcl/Tk - tcl and tk,
so you may need to also apt-get install tk
and maybe also install both of. tcl-devel and tk-devel

(use apt-get to list the available Tcl/Tk packages;  it's something like that).

ii) is certainly false,  but we can also have character arrays that are not interpreted as 
strings.

Hey guys, I'm trying to compile and run the full-solution.c, but It shows like:

fatal error: 
      'X11/Xlib.h' file not found
#       include <X11/Xlib.h>

Did I miss something that needed to compile first? Does anyone know how to fix that? 

Thanks!

What's the difference between these two in the definition list?

#define MAX_DEVICES 4
#define MAX_DEVICE_NAME 20

Is MAX_DEVICE_NAME simply the length of the of the device name?

Looking at the tracefile sample:

device    usb2       60000000 bytes/sec
device    kb         10 bytes/sec
device    ssd        240000000 bytes/sec

The example should have had at most 4 devices (which it now does).

When asking questions such as this, you should provide details of the system you're using.

But I'll assume you're using a Mac, as X11 is usually part of standard Linux distributions.

To immediately address the error you're seeing, you'll need to install the 3rd-party XQuartz 
package, see:   https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201341

However, if you're using macOS Mojave, you'll eventually find that the text on buttons isn't 
rendered unless you resize the main window.  This is because the default Tcl/Tk version on 
Mojave is still v8.5 :

  prompt>  echo 'puts $tcl_version' | tclsh

which is unaware of the new DarkMode.  v8.6 corrects this:    

  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.lang.tcl/LfYVzu192ns

Everything else work fine, but the easiest solution to this is to use the 3rd-party Homebrew 
package manager to install Tck/Tk v8.6 (if you're already using Homebrew!):

  brew install tcl-tk

____
OR, you could just build and run the solution in Lab 2.03

Hi I do not understand this sentence. "As process 2 commenced execution before 
process 1 exits, they will need to share the CPU". 
In the tracefile example the first process started at 200 seconds and ended at 400 
seconds. The second process started at 480 seconds. This means the 2 process never 
need to share the CPU because the 2nd process started after the first process 
finished as a whole.

Yes, as is the time for any I/O operations.

I read the project, and I think I have an understanding of how processes work. The 
number next to process indicates the time it takes for the process to start running 
after reboot. Process 1 takes 200 microseconds to run, but process 2 takes 480 
microseconds to run. Does this mean that both processes are running at the same time? 
Does the fact that they're from the same CPU have something to do with this?

I cannot tell if you understand it, or not, or if you're just having difficulty describing it.

(As it says on the project sheet) process 1 starts 200usecs after reboot, process 2 starts 
480usecs after reboot.   Even if process 1 performed no I/O at all, it would finish (at least) 
200+400 usecs after reboot.  Thus, process 2 starts before process 1 finishes.


> Does the fact that they're from the same CPU have something to do with this?

I don't understand this question.  There is only 1 CPU.

 From my understanding, BUFSIZE is not relevant to us,
but MAXWORD is,
and it dictates the largest length word/String that we will encounter for any word in the 
trace files that will be used.

Because as soon as one of those processes performs some I/O, (total)time will be wasted waiting for that 
I/O to complete,  if other processes can't use the CPU.

Even if there's only a single process, it still requires 5usecs to acquire the data bus for every I/O
request.

Strongly suggest you read relevant material from an OS tutorial or textbook.

I haven't used the term 'burst time' in this unit, though it is used by some textbooks, albeit with some 
different definitions.

The first process requires 400usecs on the CPU (of computation time) before it can exit.

Some texts use     CPU-burst-time = Total-process-completion-time - I/O-waiting-time

and that definition does match our project description.

Hi, I have studying experience in assembly language and C with micro-controllers (years 
ago), Java and python. But perhaps I'm not well in oral English. If you also need a partner 
and think we can work together for the project, please contact me with 
poster067@studnet.uwa.edu.au.

Cheers.

just to confirm that from the following

  i/o      8000    screen  40
  exit     8005
}
it means that process 2 starts its execution at 400 and has to execute 8005 seconds but 
also once it has completed executing 8005 usec it will ask for I/o with the execution time 
of 8000 usec

Process 2 first becomes ready to run 480usecs after the computer reboots.
After it has spent a total of 8000usecs on the CPU it makes its first I/O request.
After it has spent a total of 8005usecs on the CPU it exits.

From: chris.mcdonald@uwa.edu.au

(from Slashdot):

Exactly 28 years ago today, a 21-year-old student named Linus Torvalds made a fateful 
announcement on the Usenet newsgroup comp.os.minix

  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!original/comp.os.minix/dlNtH7RRrGA/SwRavCzVE7gJ

Android Authority describes the rest of the revolution:

Torvalds announced to the internet that he was working on a project he said was "just a 
hobby, won't be big and professional." Less than one month later, Torvalds released the 
Linux kernel to the public. The world hasn't been the same since... 

To commemorate the nearly 30 years that Linux has been available, we compiled a shortlist 
of ways Linux has fundamentally changed our lives:

  https://www.androidauthority.com/linux-1022218/

- Linux-based operating systems are the number-one choice for servers around the world... 
As of 2015, web analytics and market share company W3Cook estimated that as many as 96.4% 
of all servers ran Linux or one of its derivatives. No matter the exact number, it's safe 
to say that the kernel nearly powers the entire web...

- In Oct. 2003, a team of developers forked Android from Linux to run on digital cameras. 
Nearly 16 years later, it's the single most popular operating system in the world, 
running on more than 2 billion devices. Even Chrome OS, Android TV, and Wear OS are all 
forked from Linux. Google isn't the only one to do this either. Samsung's own in-house 
operating system, Tizen, is forked from Linux as well, and it's is even backed by The 
Linux Foundation.

- Linux has even changed how we study the universe at large. For similar reasons cars and 
supercomputers use Linux, NASA uses it for most of the computers aboard the International 
Space Station. Astronauts use these computers to carry out research and perform tasks 
related to their assignments. But NASA isn't the only galaxy studying organization using 
Linux. The privately-owned SpaceX also uses Linux for many of its projects. In 2017, 
SpaceX sent a Linux-powered supercomputer developed by HP to space and, according to an 
AMA on Reddit, even the Dragon and Falcon 9 run Linux.

HI，I have few questions
1.Since we have running time of every I/o in process, do we still need to use the rate 
to calculate the transferring time?

2.As for giving different TQ, does it means would change the running order of the 
processes or would change the order of operations in every process.

3.If the running time of a process was expired, when it restarts again does it begins 
from new or continues the previous progress.
thanks

A bit difficult to follow, but sounds correct.
Processes can only *request* an I/O operation when they're Running (on CPU), they then enter the 
appropriate queue for the required device, and may be blocked in the queue waiting for other process 
using/waiting for the databus as well.
To your calculation, add 5usecs to first acquire the bus (even if the I/O transfer size is zero!)

Yes. You don't have the running time of every process, just the order in which it makes 
requests/actions, and these will possibly be delayed by other processes.

No, the order of things does not change (within any single job-mix).

(I hope I am misunderstanding your question, but)
processes continue their execution from where they were pre-empted
(why would a process need to be restarted??)

1.Does that mean we just need to calculate the whole run-time of every process based on the begin-
time and exit-time and use different TQ to figure out what is the best total running time.If so, 
what is the meaning of giving the detail of different devices and I/o?
3.I was thinking when a process ran out of its time and went into a queue would remain the previous 
progress or not?
Thanks!

For any tracefile and time-quantum you need to determine the difference between when the first process becomes 
ready-to-run and the exit time of the last process to finish.
You will not be able to just calculate this without 'running' the schedule of processes and their I/O requests 
in the file.
 
> 3.I was thinking when a process ran out of its time and went into a queue would remain the previous 
> progress or not?

No; each time a process moves to the Running state, it receives a new, full, time-quantum.



All great questions to ask a lab demonstrator or to discuss with your project partner.

I hope these aren't stupid question but here we go:

I've read through the project and seem a little loss how to get started. I understand what 
the project wants to output at the end but I am not sure what we need to expand on the 
besttg.c file. 

1. Do we have test tracefiles we need to input to test this out?

2. In the defined statements, what does Max_Events_Per_Process mean? Is that saying per 
process there will be max 100 events? Also TIME_CONTEXT_SWITCH and TIME_ACQUIRE_BUS what do 
these mean in the context of the code?

3. In the description it has the starting time of each process after reboot. For example 
process 1 runs at 200usec and runs on the CPU until it gets an i/o request after 100usec. 
Does this mean that the process was running for 100 usec until it needed a request? Since 
this process needs a request it will need to be blocked in a specific i/o request queue 
until the request is met? Once it is met is will be in the ready queue until its called by 
the CPU as running and execute event 2 after 10usec (100+10) and since this is also a i/o 
request it will be put on a block queue like the previous event was. What do the byte 
transfer mean? Also is the aim to reduce the amount of time on the CPU. So try a method to 
reduce 200usec on the CPU for process 1.

4. The TQ0, TQfinal, TQinc, what do these 3 values represent? I understand they stand for 
time-quantum but from what I understand is the TQ0 the start and TQfinal the end?

Sorry for the long post. Any clarification would be appreciated

This has been answered already; Chris will have them when he has them.

These are global variables; that is, you are likely to use them more than once in the code, they have 
a particular meaning, and the value will not change. For example, we know in the project that when we 
switch context (i.e. move from Ready to Running) this costs us some time...

This question is a little difficult to follow. I would advise re-reading the project description 
(along with the suggested links!) to further understand. Suffice to say, the aim is not to reduce the 
amount of time on the CPU; you are just trying to identify _which_ time quanta produces the quickest 
job-mix. The byte transfer rate is rate at which information is transferred from the respective I/O 
device. 

> 4. The TQ0, TQfinal, TQinc, what do these 3 values represent? I understand they stand for

These are the command line arguments you pass to your code. Your code is supposed to identify, from a 
range of time quanta, what the best one is for a given tracefile/job-mix. If you look at the main() 
function in the code, you will see a for loop that uses the above variables. This should give you an 
indication as to what the variables are referring to. (Hint: In programming, we often shorten our 
variable names; TQinc ****might*** be referring to....)

If you're running this on a laptop, bring it to one of the labs this week and we may be able to get you sorted out. Otherwise, familiarise yourself with the code/what it does, and then compile it on one of the university Mac's. (You will have to do this when testing your project code, anyway) :)

You need to find out where the package manager has installed the header files, and then inform 
the compiler where to find them.

I'm out of practice, but I think you can find the include files with:

  apt-file search '*/tcl.h'

and then can compile jawbreaker with:

  mycc -I/the/path/just/found -o jawbreaker jawbreaker.c -ltcl -ltk

If you think about it, the result is dependent mainly on a because of the "a &&". 
That means if a is false ... end of story... the statement is false
If a is true ... we evaluate "(a||b)" ... but since we assumed a is true, the OR 
statement will always be true regardless of the value of b.

This goes back to the principle of the logical operators AND and OR. For AND if one 
part of the statement is already false then don't run the rest. For OR if one of 
the parts of the statement is true, then don't run the rest (in the same level of 
grouping operation).


Well, if all hell breaks loose, you could always just try every scenario.

1.a = true, b = true, (true)
2.a = false, b = false, (false)

3.a = true, b= false (true)
4.a = false, b = true (false)

... and maybe you could see the pattern?

I am wondering... should I have an int array[][][] of up to 50 fifty arrays (for each

Or is there a better way to record the information? Thanks

I had this problem as well, however I don't know if your situation is same as mine.
The issue of mine is that I forget to initialise the local array variable. I thought it will be 
filled as 0 automatically. 
After filled use a for loop, it solves.

Hi, I was taking a look at the past midsem papers and was a little confused about this question.

   Which one of the following statements about function parameters is true?
A. Empty parameter lists are declared with the keyword void.
B. If there is only one parameter, the parameter list is not required.
C. A function’s parameters are known as “actual parameters”.
D. A local variable may have the same name as a function’s parameter, overriding the use of the parameter.

The solution sheet said the answer was A, but I don't understand why for something like this: 

void f(int x)
{
    {
        int x = 2;
        printf("%i",x);
    }
}

wouldn't x be considered a local variable, and be used over the functions parameter x?

Cheers

Why don't you test the function you've written with different values of x for the parameter and the local variable and 
see which is printed?

You may find that seg faults that only periodically appear may be due to accessing array indices in the wrong place.  For example if I declare an array  of size 10 and try to access index 10, this will access memory outside the bounds of the array. By chance there may be memory outside the bounds of the array which appears to be valid (after all, a byte of memory could be a character, for example). However, this occasionally may not be the case and the program grinds to a halt. 

Failing that you could be getting a seg fault because you have pointers that you are attempting to dereference before they are referenced, although this can be ruled out if you don't have any pointers. Or, alternatively you are attempting to operate on an uninitialised variable.

Essentially segmentation faults will occur because: 

1. You are attempting to access / write to memory you don't own.

2. You are attempting to access memory that has been allocated virtual memory but hasn't been initialised (initialising  a variable and not allocating any value for example)

"void could be used in two ways". One, to indicate a function does not return any value. Two, the function does 
not receive a parameter.

eg. void foo(void){
 printf("HelloWorld\n")
}

All parameters declared, needs to be used or atleast receives a value

function parameters are known as "formal parameters
argument are known as "actual parameters"

Syntax Error as both definition of the variable will be of the same scope ... the scope of the function

if you true this, it will result into a syntax error. Interestingly enough... this will work

void f(){
 int x = 5;
 if(1){
   int x =3;
}
}

This is because the definition of x is in different scopes. The definition of the x in the if loop is 
constrained only there. Outside that, the scope of the outside takes over. This is not the case with parameters 
and local variable though

I talked to the lab demonstrator and got lots of help. Appreciated.
now I have few more questions:
1.when a event was ran out of TQ time and did not finish request I/O, does it directly go to ready queue without 
waiting and when it is running again will it continue with previous progress(like if an I/O need 8000 microseconds 
but the TQ is 100 microseconds, will it come back with 7900 microseconds remaining or 8000?)
2.If at a same system-time there are 3 events going to a ready queue, how to decide which would go to the queue 
first(like at 480 microseconds a new process going to ready queue when a time-out event occurs ready to queue and 
an I/O transferred event finish also going to ready queue).
3.As the commenced time in the tracefile, does this mean it would start running in CPU at that time without any 
waiting in ready queue?  
thanks!

The code example I put up compiles and prints 2, and as I understand it is because you are defining x in a new block so it can have the same name as surrounding scopes. What I am not understanding is why wouldn't this be considered a local variable (to it's scope) that overrides the function parameter. Maybe I have the exact terminology wrong or something.


Also a unrelated followup question.

In the 2018 paper Q20 why is the answer D (D. The form of the output cannot be determined from the above code.)?

For the code:

void function(void)
{
    fork();
    fork();
    printf("hello world\n");
}

I don't see why the program doesn't fork into 4 total processes and print hello world 4 times.

Hi 
I have few questions about array and function
1.How can I create an array to store many strings(like list in python) and how can I 
add new string into the array(like append in python list), like an array contains 
("abc","efg",...).If can not use array, what can be used to store?
2.if my function return an array, how can I assign the returned result into an defined 
variable outside the function . I tried creating an new array to receive the returned 
array but fail.

thanks

I may be able to answer Q1... you declare an array of char arrays with a maximum number of arrays 
(strings) and a maximum number of chars within each string. eg. char strings[5][10]; Then use 
strcpy(char destination[], char source[]) in <string.h> to put values into the array.

Interesting case, but they are still of DIFFERENT SCOPE. Hence does not override the parameter. If you try printing x outside the scope of the internal x... you would see the value of the parameter

What fork does is that it duplicates the program into multiple instances... You are not able to know the exact output since you don't know the output of other functions especially for the one that called it.

We have been doing this since the first labsheet! :) This is what happens when we use the argv array; it is in fact an array of character arrays with null-bytes (that is, an array of 'C-strings'. 


> 2.if my function return an array, how can I assign the returned result into an defined

Returning arrays from a function in C is often harder than you think because of (put simply) scope and pointers. 

If I have code that looks something like

    char* rot_array(char arr[]) {
         
        /** do something in the code here to rotate the array **/

        return arr;
    }

I am not going to be able to access this this array if I were to call rot_array in my main() function (e.g. char rotated_array = rot_array(main_array)). 

This is because if I pass my array to rot_array function, and then return the 'array' variable that is local to the rot_array function, what I am _actually_ returning is a pointer to the first element of the arr[] array. This is because when we use the name of an array variable, rather than an index of the array (i.e. arr vs. arr[0]), we are using the 'address in memory of the first element of that array. 

This will be confusing because we have not yet covered pointers, but hopefully the idea should still come across. Given that arr is a location in memory, rather than the value stored in that memory, we cannot return it from the function; this is because once we leave the function rot_array, all the variables that were declared in the scope of that function disappear, which means we are now pointing to a location in memory that doesn't exist! :O 

The 'C-style' way to do this is to pass in the address of the first element of the array you want to manipulate (in this example, that would be main_array) to the function rot_array. This means you are able to manipulate the values of main_array directly, rather than returning a rotated 'copy' of the array.

Yes. Simplify your arrays; there is nothing wrong with having 5+ arrays that store the required information separately from each other. You shouldn't need a 15,000 element 3-D matrix to store the information.

I am just a little confused and need some guidance in understanding the time-quantum.

The project wants to have three values which are TQ0, TQfinal and TQinc. From looking 
at the project description saying that process 1 starts at 200usec after reboot. Is 
this what TQ0 means? Therefore TQfinal is the final time of the last executed event in 
the process? This then makes it confusing that the increment TQ value is for?

I think I am just lost to how to use the time-quantum.

Thanks.

You cannot assign (copy) one array to another using the assignment operator,  =
You need to use the standard  strcpy()  function, seen in Lecture 7.

Unless you've changed your code a lot, from what appears above, you may not be compiling 
your code with the helpful command-line options to warn against problems.

There's no-where in your code, above, to correctly perform a strcpy().

It's unclear why you have an array of 4 pointers to characters, and we cannot see a 
definition of de_name.

Let's say two processes currently exist and one of them is about to reach the end of 
their time quantum on the CPU. One process is moved from "Running" to "Ready" and the 
other experiences the opposite. Do both these switches occur simultaneously (5 
microseconds total) or would they be done consecutively thus taking 10 microseconds?

This is the difference between 'pre-increment' and 'post-increment'. When we pre-increment, we change the value before the expression; in post-increment, we change the value after the expression. 

If you have:

x = 5;
a = x++;
printf("x: %d, a: %d\n",x,a);


You would get: x: 6, a: 5. 
x = 5;
a = ++x;
printf("x: %d, a: %d\n",x,a);

You would get:  x: 6, a: 6.

The answer to this was B, but I'm confused as to why. If the function is of type void, 
then how is it it's able to have 0 or more return statements? It's a void function so 
I thought it just doesn't return anything.

Thank you

I find that there is a "reboot" in the tracefile.
is that meaning we should calculate the time in the function parse_tracefile? or just 
ignore it?

 else if(nwords == 1 && strcmp(word0, "reboot") == 0) {

The project description says:

So, yes, we do ignore it  :)

Hi Chris,

On lecture7's slide, the strlen() was labeled as int type.
I tried to print a value from the function with placeholder %i but failed. However, in 
C library, the strlen() function seems to have a size_t type. I don't know if I called 
the function incorrectly or it was a typo on the slide.


And the questions(or confirmation):

1. Is it true that \0,\r,\n do not count for the length of an array but each occupies 
storage of 1 byte?

2. Is it true that the read() function returns the storage(in byte) of the file it 
reads?

3. Is it true that we can define an array as large as we want, and if we don't fill it 
up with enough value, the rest of the space will be filled up with a bunch of 0s? (I 
tried to print the unassigned spaces out but only get 0s.)


Thank you for your time.

Is a 2d array a wise way to store the information in the tracefile. Im only asking 
because it'd be useful to have device name and its transfer rate together instead 
of being in multiple seperate arrays. If they were in different arrays its be 
difficult to access the data

There's only a single 5usec cost.  For the future, consider that it occurs when any process moves 
from Ready->Running.

You are correct;  the true definition of the function is  size_t strlen(char array[])
where size_t is an 'unsigned long' integer - it's unsigned, because lengths cannot be negative, 
so the permissible values are 0 or higher.

You can print such a value with:   printf("%lu\n", strlen( string ) );



> And the questions(or confirmation):

All characters occupy 1 byte.
Only the \0 byte ends the counting of the length, and is not counted; all other characters 
contribute to the length.
But a simple thing for you to test yourself with a small program.

No - man 2 read - the return value indicates the number of bytes read, or an error.

True, but it's only guaranteed for global arrays, not locals.

Your project will likely have 10 or more arrays, but each will probably be (only) 1 or 2 
dimensions.

Remember that each array element has to have the same type, so you will not be able to store 
characters and integers in the same array  (hence the need for multiple arrays).

You want a 2-dimensional array of characters.  No pointers required.
Please read an online C tutorial or textbook, rather than asking a sequence of individual questions through 
the forum.

The keyword 'return' does not have to provide a value in all cases.
You're correct - if a function is of type void, then the function doesn't return a value, but 
control still needs to return (go back to) wherever the function was called.

I think you might be approaching it the wrong way...
Chris has kindly written the code for reading the file for us,
so there's no need to do it yourself

His comments in parse_tracefile are big hints about where you need to write the code for 
saving the data
e.g.
// FOUND A DEVICE DEFINITION, WE'LL NEED TO STORE THIS SOMEWHERE  
(i.e. we need do something in this location)

You shouldn't need to change the main method at all (I think)

Btw, here is a full program that makes a valid use of strcpy:

{{{
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main()
{
	char strArr[50];
	strcpy(strArr, "I'm a string going into strArr");
	printf("\nTest: %s", strArr);

    return 0;
}
}}}

thanks for the reply.
but what makes me confuse is that reboots mean in the process.
for example,
process  1  200 {
  i/o      100     hd      1600
  i/o      110     usb2    1600
  i/o      180     hd      1000
  i/o      190     usb2    1000
  exit     400
}
chirs says "Process 2 first becomes ready to run 480usecs after the computer reboots." and the 
description says "Process number 1 commenced execution at 200 microseconds (after the operating system 
rebooted)." . is it correct to think that (you said to ignore the 'reboot') each time, before the 
process1 commences to run, it needs to wait for 200 microseconds in CPU?

    switch ( fork() ) {

        break;

    case 0:                       // new child process
        printf("child is pid=%i\n", getpid() );

        for(int t=0 ; t<3 ; ++t) {
            printf("  tick\n");
            sleep(1);
        }
        exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
        break;

    default: {                    // original parent process

        exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
        break;
    }

Which produces the output on my system:

{{{
parent waiting
child is pid=7932
  tick
  tick
  tick
process pid=7932 terminated with exit status=0
}}}

My question is, would it ever occur that after fork() was called program execution was passed to the child before the parent? If not, what mechanism ensures that the parent's code is run before the child's?

Basically I am asking, is it possible to get the following output:

{{{
child is pid=7932
  tick
  tick
  tick
parent waiting
process pid=7932 terminated with exit status=0
}}}

Yes, I think you are on the right track, but to clarify: 

The way I interpret it is simple: 'reboot' means time 0

 "Process 2 first becomes ready to run 480usecs after the computer reboots." 
 -> simply means the process 2 starts 480 usecs after 0

 "Process number 1 commenced execution at 200 microseconds (after the operating system 
 rebooted)." 
 -> simply means the process 2 starts 200 usecs after 0

 From your previous question, 
I thought you were trying to take into account how long 'parse tracefile' takes into the time of a simulation

Each time 'simulate job mix' starts, 
you reset that simulation's time to 0, 
and every time, process 1 starts at 200 usecs (so yes it does sort of have to 'wait' for 200usecs)
I think it might be that simple 

I hope that helps :)

I think one of the cases was that the RAM is full and no more programs can be loaded into 
memory, which would result in less than 4 printed lines (due to less loaded child processes)

You are getting the same output because you are not encountering any 'edge' cases

I'd recommend watching the previous lecture because this was discussed  :)

Try increasing the size of the array from 4 to 10, or even 20
I think it might be getting overloaded

Also, try printing out the value of device_name after parse_tracefile is done
I think it will make you rethink another part of your declaration ;)

It is likely the name of the device is greater than 4 characters; your device_name array is only going to store 4 characters.

maybe you could try to use a pointer char* rather than char array
char array is also a string
e.g. for an array: char array[5]="hello", then arr[1]='e' which is type of char;
     for a pointer: char* arr[4] arr[1]="hello", arr[2]="world",arr[1][1]='e'
print type for arr[1] is string, for arr[1][1]is char

No, but...
Process-2 starts at the indicated 480usecs, but 'starting' doesn't mean it starts running on the CPU, 
it means it's ready-to-run, and so goes into the ready queue.

Totally ignore I/) - using exactly the example on the project page, if you have a time quantum longer 
than 480usecs, then process-2 will stay in the ready queue, while process-1 is running, until the end 
of that TQ or until process-1 exits.

However, add I/O back into the mix, and the inter-twining sequence of process execution gets too 
'messy' to simply think about.

Experiment with some simpler tracefiles, that have no I/O, like those on the Clarifications page.

It's a good question, paraphrasing "which runs first, the parent or the child?"
In all cases for which I've looked at the kernel code, or read about, the child process runs first - BUT knowing this is beyond the scope of the detail in this unit.


In 'theory' (not really theory), either process can run first- BUT applications processes should not rely on that.
In 'practice' the child runs first as it's more efficient when copy-on-write is implemented. It's most likely that the child will not modify its copy of the parent's memory, and will very quickly just exec() another 
program into the same memory space.

These things do get defined in formal operating-system standards (not in the C99 standard);  for example here's a list of things that fork() has to do:

  https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/fork.html   (it's not a manual entry).

Thanks for reporting this;  I obviously want to fix it, but can't follow what you're seeing.
You say it's reporting:

  "./besttq-sample: line 9:  ...."

which suggests that you'd changed directory to /cslinux/bin to run it - that's OK, but not 
necessary.

Still checking to resolve it, though surprised that more students aren't reporting it ....

This is really just a general programming question (and answer), not specific to C.
You'll need a multi-dimensional array, where the first dimension is used to identify the process 
you're using/wanting, and the other dimension(s) record that process's actual I/O details.

This line:

{{{

}}}

does not add a null-byte after the character 'e'.
Thus arr does not hold a string, and you cannot pass it to strlen().

Any result of using this is undefined, you may get some nonsense output or (if you're lucky) your 
program will crash.

unless you know what you're doing, please don't attempt to use pointers, or encourage

Think more clearly about what you're trying to store:

- you have multiple devices (and you know the maximum number of such devices),
- each device name has multiple characters (and you know the maximum number of such   
  characters).

char device_name[4]  is ONE array of just FOUR characters - clearly not meeting your storage 
requirements.

Hi Chris,


The answer got me a bit confused. Isn't it true that defining a char array in such a way will result in 
a "string"? If not, then how is a string defined? 
Do we need to manually place a null-byte after each char array for it to pass to strlen()? 

This is the code I wrote and it prints "The length of array is 6" without a problem.

Hi Chris,

Given the sample trace file provided:

process  1  200 {
  i/o      100     hd      1600
  i/o      110     usb2    1600
  i/o      180     hd      1000
  i/o      190     usb2    1000
  exit     400
}
process  2  480 {
  i/o      8000    usb2    40
  exit     8005
}

And given your answer to a previous question - that the indicated start time of the process 
is when the process is added to the Ready queue - are we to understand that this tracefile 
runs as follows:

200 microsecs after reboot:
Add process 1 to ready queue

300 microsecs:
Our first I/O request is made, so add this to a priority queue (which is of course empty at 
this point) so it should be executed immediately

310 microsecs:
Second I/O request made, add to priority queue

380 microsecs:
Third I/O request add to priority queue

390 microsecs:
Fourth I/O request, add to priority queue

480 microsecs:
Process 2 begins, add it to Ready queue

Now process 1 and process 2 are running concurrently, so if the time quantum for process 1 
runs out before it finishes execution, then we move it to our Ready queue, and run process 
2. Process 1 and 2 now change context back and forth depending on the length of our time 
quantum.

600 microsecs:
Process 1 exits

8480 microsecs:
Final I/O request made, add to priority queue

8485 microsecs:
Process 2 exits

Additionally, each time we make an I/O request (unless we are already using the databus), 
we move a process to the Blocked queue, until that request is satisfied. Consider a case 
where there are no other devices using the databus when we make such a request, my 
interpretation of the situation is thus:

Mark process as blocked - +5 microsecs
Acquire databus - +5 microsecs
Mark process as ready - +5 microsecs
Run process again - +5 microsecs

If the databus is already being utilised by a different process, then:

Mark our process as blocked, current process continues running until transfer is complete 
or its time quantum is exhausted - +5 microsecs + however many microsecs current 
transfer/time quantum takes to finish
Our process acquires the databus - +5 microsecs
Mark our process as ready - +5 microsecs
Run our process - +5 microsecs

Clarification: when I use the term 'priority queue', I don't refer to any inherent priority 
our I/O requests are imbued with, I just mean to say that they they are ordered according 
to the length of time they have been waiting.

Anyway, sorry for the longwinded post, but if you could confirm my assumptions about the 
project that would be great!

I thought about that as well, but since the question states the "code executes successfully", I

Hello, the value 440800 is just a ‘made-up’ example,  it does not apply to the tracefile 
listed on the project sheet.

Also, please note, that process-2 does not end at 8005,  but ends when process-2 has spent 
8005usecs executing ON THE CPU.

On device priority - the device with the highest transfer-rate has the highest priority.
If two or more processes request some I/O from different devices, the device with the 
highest priority (fastest transfer rate) will get to acquire the databus first.

The fact that your example code is working is just through luck.
Your string (between the double quote) is 6 characters long - the same size as your array, so the array 
will then hold your 6 characters, but nothing will automatically add a null-byte to that array  (where you it go!?)

Either, you need to add null-bytes to your own arrays, understand when the compiler does this for you, or use 
functions such as strcpy() which are defined/implemented to add the null-byte to their destination array.

Good luck,

if cpu meet a “hd” command after finish executing a i/o command, at the same time, there

should the cpu execute this "hd" command immediately, or execute the i/o command at

Therefore, is there a parity between i/o command and hd command? Or, the hd command is 
not execute by cpu?

Oh...

I got confused because you said \0 does not count for the length of an array.

So is it true that even though \0 is not counted in strlen(), we still need to take it into consideration when we are 
defining an array?

So,

char array1[6] = "hello"

would be a perfect "string" ended by a \0.
But when are using strlen(), we'll get 5 instead of 6.

I strongly doubt that I said that.

A \0 byte does count (add) to an array's length (it needs storing somewhere), but
a \0 byte does not count (add) to the value returned by strlen().

In fact, the character sequence "hello\0world" requires 12 bytes to store it,
but passing it to strlen() will return the value 5.

Wait, so does that mean the order of which the i/o will execute may not be in the same order as 
they're described in the tracefile? Using this tracefile as an example:

process  1  200 {
  i/o      100     hd      1600
  i/o      110     usb2    1600
  i/o      180     hd      1000
  i/o      190     usb2    1000
  exit     400
}
process  2  480 {
  i/o      8000    usb2    40
  exit     8005
}

Say if usb2 has a higher transfer rate than hd, would the i/o (and I mean all i/o) from that device be 
executed first due to its priority, no matter when they're placed into queue?

Also quick question, are the usecs of the data bus and context switch included in the time quantum 
limits?

Hi Chris, 

It looks like the shell script that is 'best-sample' is trying to run either 'besttq-sample-[OS]'; 
however, in the /Volumes/cslinux/bin directory, there is no besttq-sample-mac/linux file.

I would guess that Chris means the code did not error out.

fork() returns a negative number if no children are created, it does not terminate or cause the 
program to terminate.

So we are to assume that the code did not execute successfully and it, therefore, doesn't print out

I reviewed lectures last night and found that in lecture6 or 7 ,it says that fork is for mac OS& linux, 
createprocess is for windows.
But fork() function worked well when I executed the program in my windows computer...

Thanks Ryan;  all weird, because it's not been looking for /Volumes since early this morning.

that is helpful.
so you mean that all the time calculation should do in the 'simulate job mix' and don't need to consider the time spent in 
the other function such as 'parse tracefile'. right?
and after 480 usecs, process 2 can start in whatever situation.for example, when the process2 was 'block' and then go back 
to 'run', it doesn't need to wait for 480 usecs again. right?
one more question, should I calculate more 5 usecs to the very begin process 1(after 200 usecs from reboot), because it 
should be transform from 'ready' to 'run'?

Hi
I try to understand the project of the following processes based on the multiple blocking 
model.

if TQ is 200ms.
process 1 started in Ready queue at 200ms system-time after reboot, then take 5ms from 

ready to running in CPU. Then it takes 100ms running in CPU then make the first I/o 

request(at system-time 300ms), and then take another 5ms to go to the blocked queue for 

appropriate device (hd in this scenario).Then the process take 5ms to acquire a data bus 

and start to transfer which takes (1600/80000000)*1000000 = 20ms.Then it goes to  Ready 

queue for another I/o request or ask for exit...

Does my understanding should be corrected?

cheers

Yes, 5usecs are needed for a context switch to occur, according to the project description

"Today, Unix powers iOS and Android—its legend begins with a gator and a trio of researchers. Maybe its pervasiveness has long

worldwide, was born 50 years ago from the failure of an ambitious project that involved titans like Bell Labs, GE, and MIT. 
Largely the brainchild of a few programmers at Bell Labs, the unlikely story of Unix begins with a meeting on the top floor of

I want to ask a few questions regarding this first sample:

process 1 10 {
    exit        40
}

So the process is added to a queue when 10 usecs have passed, but since it's the only 
process in the queue, it immediately moves to ready state. At 50 usecs, it's 
terminated. How is the total process completion time calculated here? Do we need to 
add 50 usecs as well as 5 usecs for the context switches? I assume it goes from null -
> ready -> run(?) -> exit. 
And what about the time quantum? If the total process completion time was less than 
the time quantum, would the best time quantum just be the time quantum, or would it be 
equal to the time completion (assuming 3 arguments)?
I wasn't able to test the samples provided at the labs this week, so I'm kinda lost at 
what the output will be.

Thank you

Hello Chris,

May I ask that if there is any different between event and child process?

Are they the same things?

Because the project requires us to start an event of a process, on the basis of the 
fork() function that we talked about this week, are we required to use this 
function for the start of a process?

I don't know whether it is a stupid question but I wanna ask for your help.

From: poster119@student.uwa.edu.au

I am just needing some clarification if what I think I know is correct.

I've had a look at different algorithms for scheduling. The first I saw was the first 
in first serve (FIFS) which executes the process until the burst time. Another was the 
round robin algorithm which uses a time quantum for each process. e.g. it might take 
30usec to run the process but time-quantum is 20usec so after 20usec the process goes 
back into the queue.

Therefore, Is the purpose of the assignment to find the best time-quantum (so use a 
round robin algorithm) to complete all processes? If so then if all processes have a 
burst time is the difference in the optimal time going to be how we put processes in 
queues since transition will takes 5usec?

I'm confused because all processes need to run for the amount they have so the only 
way to lower the time is to lower the amount of transitions isn't it?

I am probably way off but just need clarifications and guidance.

Hi, 
I feel like there a lot of cases in this project that I'm don't feel I can use my 
own judgement on...
Please help me with these

Q1 
If a process starts at 200us , does this mean we need to start the 'context 
switching process'
at 195us, so that it is ready by 200us?
Similarly, would data bus accesses need to start the 'accessing operation' 5 usecs 
before event start-times as well?

Q2
So does a context switch of 5 usecs involve 2 transitions (Running -> 
Ready/Blocked), and (Ready -> Running)
Or will that require one context switch each?  (resulting in 10 usecs)
(I know there is a sentence about this in the description, but I had trouble 
definitively saying whether it was one or the other)

Q3
Lets say TQ = 20
A process runs for 20usecs, ends at 100usecs, and no other processes exist
Will it just ignore the TQ interrupts at 20usecs, 40usecs ... ?
(And thus also no context switching will occur?)

Q4
Lets say TQ = 20
Process 1 has run for 20usecs, will end at 100usecs, and Process 2 is on the Ready 
queue
The 'time quantum interrupt' occurs at 20 usecs so now:
- Process 1 needs to be placed in Ready Queue for 20 usecs
- Process 2 needs to be ran for 20 usecs
Will the context switch occur between the processes? (i.e start at 21 and end at 26)
Or will it start at 20 and end at 25? 

Q5
About the tracefile in the project description, and the events of Process 1 :
-  (Event 1)  i/o    100             hd          1600 
-  (Event 2)  i/o    110             usb2          1600 
Event 1 starts at 100, and after using the formula (time = data / data speed), it 
can be determined that it finishes at 120
But since only one device can be accessed at one time, how can Event 2 start at 110?
Will it only start if it has a higher priority?
Or are the values in the project description just random? 

Q6
Can we use pointers and other C constructs in this project even though we haven't 
covered them yet?
(Assuming we are confident with them)

Many thanks,
Anon

Another question.

Is the data transfer of the device the amount that has been "used" on the CPU. I'm wondering 
what the data transfer is for.

Also, in the example trace-file on the project description the first process runs for 100usec 
then goes into the queue and then to ready. Is running to blocked to ready 5 + 5 = 10usec or 
just 5sec?

In the project description, it says that it takes for 5 microseconds for one process to go 
from Running to Ready and another one to go from Ready to Running. Does that mean it takes 
10 microseconds in total, or that both context-switches take place in the same 5 
microseconds? If it's the latter, then how long would it take to move just one process from 
Ready to Running (i.e. without moving a process from Running to Ready).

Also, does moving a process from Running to Exit take any time?

Thanks!

It only takes 5 microseconds for both to take place (source: asked the lab instructor). If only

I'm not sure whether total process completion time includes the time between the OS

It's taking our IT support too long to resolve the problems with access to a sample 
command-line solution, so let's try something else.

Visit the URL   https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/besttq-sample

  - enter your tracefile contents into the textbox,
  - choose some time-quantum values, and
  - execute the sample solution.

It's not pretty, but should be more helpful than a command-line solution.

See the Clarifications page (25th August)
  http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/projects/project1-clarifications.php  
for some sample tracefiles. 

Please report any problems you find.

hello, looking for a project partner. New to C, have completed the first year java 
unit and have some experience with cits2200. Don't expect me to carry or anything 
because i am not confident with coding. i believe i can probably score a 55-60% for 
this assessment on my own, it will take time but i will get there. so if you are 
interested contact me on poster118.

Cheers,
Michael

hi,
I tried my best to achieve the goal of the project in 'simulate_job_mix'.
however, whatever the array or building structure, it is hard to track the process in 
different states.
in Java, it is easy to use the priority queue and a structure to achieve that, but in C, I 
am no idea. I have spent a whole day to think about it and get nothing, that makes me so 
upset.
do you have any hint about how to realise 5-State Model of Process Execution?
thanks

Yes, processes that have been blocked longer than others *for the same device* have priority over ones 
blocked for less time, but the devices also have priorities base don their transfer rates.

I'm confused by the wording of your question.
"hd" is the name of a device, a common abbreviation for "hard disk".

There is no specific command named "hd", but there are (many possible) I/O requests that are made to 
possibly different devices.  One such I/O request could be made to the device named "hd".

No, completely unrelated.
The time-quantum only refers to the time that the currently running process "owns" the CPU.

Not a stupid question, just a bit difficult to understand.
The project does not assume/require any specific method of process creation - we just know when 
each process starts, but not how.

However, you will not need to use fork() in the project at all - we are not running real 
processes, just simulating ones defined in the tracefile.

Yes, you may use any C features you're comfortable with, but you won't receive any additional 
marks for using more advanced features (that we haven't covered).

However, the whole project can be completed the C features covered by the end of Week-4 - basic 
data types, arrays, loops, and functions receiving parameters.  That is all the sample solution 
uses.

Our on-CPU scheduling is a round-robin approach, using the same time-quantum for each simulation.  
You will observe different total completion times when different processes make different I/O 
requests, which compete with each other for the use of the single data-bus.

Is a 1metre x 1metre piece of concrete a square?

The more 'philosophical' question might be "is a single item array storing just one '1', an 
array full of 1s, is its main diagonal all 1s, or are both diagonals all 1s" ??
The resolution of this, as for all multi-choice test questions, is to provide the most 
general correct answer for all cases.

Yes; we're stating that Ready->Running takes 5usecs,
but all other transitions take no time.

____
(In practice, all transitions do take some time, but in attempting to simplify the project a bit, we're 
using the above.  It would be easy to have more pre-processor #define values for each transition type, 
perhaps with some set to zero, but let's keep it simple).

You will need a number of arrays, holding the information in the tracefile.
You will need different arrays to hold the device information, the process information, and the Running 
and Blocked I/O queues.

The information in these arrays, once initialised with the information in the tracefile, is not changed 
or updated, as we'll need to run the simulation several times, while only varying the time-quantum.

You've clearly expressed that this is difficult for you - are you working with, and discussing your 
understanding and design, with a project partner?

I am wondering what the data transfer means and whether its actually important in the 
project. For example the example in the description has 4 events of data transfer:

1600
1600
1000
1000

What do these mean? If the transfer is higher does this mean the process has higher 
priority?

Those numbers are how many bytes of data were transferred during the events

Combined with the transfer speeds from the device definitions, 
we can calculate how long an I/O event will take.

This website is useful:
http://www.calctool.org/CALC/prof/computing/transfer_time

I've attached an image that demonstrates how to do this for Process 1, Event 1 from the

Sorry a further question.

I understand that the parse_file function will require us to store the files content in arrays. 
However, for example say process 1 is stored into an array of processes. I would also assume that 
the events are stored in a sperate array. The problem that I can't seem to solve is how can we 
link the process number to the various lengths of events.

For example:

processes[0] will contain process 1. 

say that process has 10 events of requests etc. How do we link the events with the process.

events[0] events[1] .... so on up to events[10] will have events for process 1 in process[0]

I am not sure if I ma doing this correct because I can't seem to figure out a way to create a 
control-flow to use the time-quantum.

Thanks David.

So if the process spends 100 usec on the CPU before the request, what is the purpose of the data 
transfer time in the overall completion time? Is it used to check which request has higher 
priority?

Yep that made sense.

The only issue I am having is the storing of the data. For example: I have an array of 
processes that stores the process number. so process[0] = 1 process[1] = 2 etc.

Before we start doing the algorithm in the job_simulation function, all the content of the 
tracefile will be in some data structure if I am correct? 

Say process 1 and 2 have these events:

process 1 200 {
i/o  100 hd 1600
i/o  110 usb2 1000
exit 200
}
process 2 300 {
i/o 100 hd 2000
exit 200
}

Therefor, if process 1 runs fro 100 usec, it goes into the block queue, then process 2 
moves from ready to running and after 100 usec, the process goes into block queue. Does 
this mean that process 2 will be ahead of process 1 in the queue for I/O request because 
the data_rate is higher? Is this how it works

Yes, all the data will be in data structures
The constants at the top of besttq.c will determine their sizes

I think you are on the right track. 
I think it would be helpful for you to use Chris's scheduler 
(https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/besttq-sample) with this tracefile I made from your 
question and another one: 

device    usb2       60000000 bytes/sec
device    ssd        240000000 bytes/sec
device    hd         80000000 bytes/sec
device    screen     200000 bytes/sec
reboot

process 1 200 {
i/o  100 hd 1600
i/o  110 usb2 1000
exit 200
}
process 2 300 {
i/o 100 hd 2000
exit 200
}

I am working individually.
I did use the different array to store the tracefile information.
you say "You will need different arrays to hold the device information, the process information, and the Running and 
Blocked I/O queues.", it is correct to think that we need to implement 'queue' in C like java?

Thanks, this helped a lot!

One question!

Will the process order be consistent. For example process 1 starts first, process 2 second and so 
on (not necessarily saying they finish in that order) or are they random?

Hi

I was wondering how we can store the I/O in relation to the process number. Because we 
haven't done stuff on tuples or dictionaries how do we relate say process 1 to 5,6 or what 
ever number of events per process. This is a way I thought:

processes[0]

event[0], event[1] relate to process 1 with 2 events

process[1]

event[2][event[3] relate to process 2 with 2 events.

My issue I am proposing is how when doing the calculations are we meant to relate the 2 
arrays with each other if they are different lengths? For example if process 2 is running 
how do I extract the events in the event[] array that relate to process 2?

Cheers.

Unlike Java's native Queue interface, C does not have a native queue datatype, and to implement a 'true' queue in C you'd need a 
knowledge of pointers and dynamic memory allocation, neither of which we've yet covered.

However, if you think of the minimal requirements for queues - to append to its tail and remove from its head (a FIFO), you should 
be able to see that a fixed-size array and an integer are all you required.

The only use of priorities in the project applies to devices (their data transfer rates), which have nothing to do 
with processes queued in the Ready state.

Yes, you may assume that the processes in the tracefile appear in their order of creation (when they first 
become Ready).

(I could have permitted them to appear in a 'random' order, but that wouldn't physically align with the idea 
of each process's definition appearing in the order that the processes did,  and there's no point/intent in 
making the project any more difficult than it needs to be!)

There's been a flurry of articles in the computing media over the past 2 weeks about the ascendency of Rust as the 'next systems 
programming language', to replace C.

While most of the the articles have been written by strong advocates of Rust, I've found the follow-up comments by readers of the articles 
to be more interesting.  They give a good perspective on why things (in computing), that have been entrenched for a long time, are very 
hard to displace, and why we shouldn't be too quick to all jump on the bandwagon of the next-new-thing.

Some very interesting points, both for and against the Rust programming language.

I'm a little puzzled about the outputs. I was under the assumption that if you only 
put 3 arguments into the function, it would either return the time quantum given and 
the total process completion time at that point, or the time quantum that gives the 
best total process completion time. But when I tested it out, no matter if there was 3 
or 5 arguments, the total process completion time ended up the same (just in case, I 
will say that this was for tfC, with 595 usecs...always).

I wanted to ask to ask about the expected output: would the output of the function 
return the total process completion time at a certain time quantum, or does it just 
give the overall total process completion time regardless?

Thank you

i'm really struggling to see what kind loop we need to use to simulate the job mix. my 
idea was that we can use a while loop based on the number of processes present being 
more than 0 and whenever a process exits it will take 1 away from the number processes 
present. is this roughly the right direction?

From: chris.mcdonald@uwa.edu.au

There's a concerning number of students seeking help on how to design their data-structures for the 1st 
project, and a number of students still seeking project partners (and they'll likely struggle at this 
late stage).  The project can be implemented using only 1-D and 2-D arrays, and an understanding of C 
covered by Week-4﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿,  so it's concerning (surprising) to me that students are struggling in this way in a 
2nd year unit.

So, in the hope of addressing this situation (and to give my mailbox a rest), we'll change the week's 
Schedule this week:

  - Monday, Lecture-11
  - Tuesday, Workshop-5 (see  http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/workshops/workshop5.php )
  - Friday, Lecture-12

If you're struggling to make a start on the project, particularly with how to store and access the 
information in our tracefiles, then attempt the Workshop-5 exercise, and get along on Tuesday morning.

Good luck,

If you pass an array to a function and modify that parameter's contents in the function then, on 
return from the function, the original array will have been modified.

No need to return an array, and no need for pointers.

(How else could the strcpy() function work?)

You will not observe different total process completion times until you try (carefully chosen) 
examples involving I/O.

Can someone please help me to format my printed strings in neat columns like Chris has 
done?
In other words, can we print a table in the shell?
If someone could figure this out,  my OCD would be eternally grateful

P.S
I've tried :
1. Making 3 arrays of size 20
2. Filling all spaces with one character
3. Overwriting the larger string with smaller one's characters (going from 0 to 
smaller length)
4. Added the nullbyte to the last index
But somehow it never works when I print it. Its always slightly off

Not sure what this has to do with the shell(?),
but if you have strings to print in C, then

    printf("%-20s", string);   will left-justify them in 20 spaces, and
    printf("%20s", string);    will right-justify them in 20 spaces

with spaces used to pad both.

I'm not convinced!  Running

      ./program
and.  ./program > filename

will produce the same output. There is no modification or conversion of the output just 
because it's going to a file instead of the screen.

I suspect that your output lines also have some tab characters in them, and when you look 
at the output file using a text editor, you have an editor preference for soft-tabstops set 
to something other than 8.

The device names  usb, kb, hd, ssd  are just examples, and could be any strings.
I might test the projects with  horse, cow, cat, and dog  and they should all still work the same.

(unsure why you're asking this, or how it relates to optimising your solution).

Hi Chris, during doing the project, I still have some unclear points that need to ask you.

1. If the acquire bus need 5ns, does CPU need to participate in this 5ns?
2. Does the time of context switch count in quantum?
3. Do we need to calculate the time of context switch in exit process?

Looking forward to your reply!!!

No  (in practice, the motherboard can perform bus negotiation on behalf of the CPU).
And it's 5 microseconds, 5usecs, not 5nsecs.

> 2. Does the time of context switch count in quantum?

No.  The only state transition with an actual cost if Ready->Running, which doesn't involve the time-
quantum at all.

No. See the Clarifications page.

for tfb.txt, a process with no I/o process and executes for several time quantum. 

would it be a good idea to have global variables to keep track of the total time left 
for a process to finish. so I will have a global variable of value 300(time taken for 
process 1 to complete) and each time I will take the time quantum from 300.

There's a number of ways to solve this, but most don't involve trying to *calculate* the 
time.  Once you have I/O added into your job mix, attempting to calculate the next future 
event becomes (too) difficult.

Instead, most approaches simply let time advance, from 0usecs at reboot, and check if 
anything happens at the current time.  So your rough structure becomes:

{{{
void simulate_job_mix(int TQ)
{
   ...
   int CLOCK = 0;         // time at reboot
   while(number_of_exited_processes < number_of_processes) {
      if(anything happens at this time) {
          ....
      }
      ++CLOCK;
   }
}
}}}

I think you may be incorrectly mixing together the concepts of the time-quantum and the time at 
which a process exits.
And your solution will be better if you can minimise your use of global variables.

Yes, I haven't compiled/tested my project on a Mac.
However, I will do so once I finish my project.
I have planned to finish early and will leave a few days in case anything happens.

Oh I use round when I calculate transfer time.
(data / speed) can give values like 26.7, which needs to rounded up to 27
(26.7 is for event 2 of process 1 in the project page trace file)

I just realised that I could write my own round() method ..

You will find, on a Mac, that Apple have included the functions of the maths library into the 
standard library, so you do not explicitly need to specify the maths library.

Yes, but what if the ratio gives 26.4 - then round() will give the result of 26.
But that doesn't help you, because at time=26, the I/O hasn't finished yet.

> I just realised that I could write my own round() method .. 

Yes, but round() is not the approach you seek.

> but I am interested to know why that linker error occurs

The linker error only occurs if you've called the round() function, but not told the linker 
where to find its implementation.

Different user here,
I don't understand how maintaining a record of how many items are in the queue helps at all. 
I'm assuming the queue is based on a FIFO (First in first out) principle, so how does some 
value representing how many items are in the queue, record the first process that should be 
moved from Ready->Running. I would imagine a 1-D array would be a better approach since you 
could have some method to push the process number into the back of the array and have have the 
first element 'popped' when moving a process from Ready->Running, hence forming some priority 
to which process should be moved.
Please correct me if I am wrong :)

If you don't maintain a count of the number of items in the queue/array, then *where* do you "push .... 
into the back of the array" ?

append_to_queue() is adding one beyond the (known) known number of items, increments count.
remove_from_queue() removes from [0], shuffles all remaining items down, decrements count.

I'm considering using structures instead of arrays for this project. While structures do 
seem like the cleaner/easier method I have read that searching and accessing elements in

time constraints? Any thoughts?

I've just realised that the process time 
is not an issue at all but manipulating 
the elements might be. For example, we can 
append to arrays to increment, and 
decrement by removing the element at [0] 
and shifting all remaining elements. Would 
structures cause any problems with this?

The besttq.c template we were provided expressly defines a constant MAX_PROCESSES as 50 and 
MAX_EVENTS_PER_PROCESS as 100, and although it has been updated now, the besttq solution originally 
contained a 'silly' tracefile with 9 processes - each with several I/O requests. So I would say err on 
the side of caution and prepare for the 'worst case' scenario.

Yes; it's very realistic for process to commence immediately on booting.
Multiple processes can also start at the same time, too, in their order of appearance in 
the tracefile.

But how does this affect your implementation - why a concern?

Yes, your project should support more than 2 processes.

But your project is not 'solving' the contents of the tracefile - it's simulating or 
emulating the job-mix.

Thankyou for explaining the compiler error, I understand that now

But I'm still unsure about rounding..

Here is some analysis of the tracefile in the project description:
@ T = 345 Process 1 is moved to Blocked(usb2), there is a difference of 32us (377-345 = 32us) 
((1600/60000000) x 10^6 = 26.67) -> round to 27us, 27+5 = 32us

@ T = 452 Process 1 is moved to Blocked(hd), 
difference of 18us (470 - 452 = 18us)
((1000/80000000) x 10^6 = 12.5)-> round to 13us, 13+5 = 18us

It seems like rounding is required for the numbers to work out...

Unsure why you're asking this.

The project sheet says  "We may assume that the format of each tracefile is correct, and its data 
consistent, so we do not need to check for errors in the tracefile." and, as no other operation types 
have been defined, any 'random' ones would make the tracefile invalid.  Moreover, the starting code 
reports lines that are not recognised.

What are you anticipating?

What is the result of   round(26.4) ?

It's 26 and, if you move process states at 26usecs, instead of 27, then the I/O will not have completed 
and your program/process would not be performing correctly.

Have you looked at the ceil() function?

You will need to keep track of the time quantum remaining for the currently running process.
You can track whether the time quantum has expired by either counting up to its maximum, or 
counting down to zero.  Whether it is a global variable simply depends on which functions need 
access to it - if just a single function, then it should be local to that function.

But these are really just simple programming decisions, not related to the project's logic.

Of note, a process may perform I/O or exit part way through its allocated quantum - it doesn't
only happen at the end.

(I'm unsure why you're concerned if this is overcomplicating it?  Do you have another, simpler, 
approach?)

Hi Chris,

I think why so few students answered Q10 
correctly is because a syntax error does 
indeed exist on line C: the loop is 
missing a semicolon after "i<N".

With regards to Q13, the function does 
produce a square array of zeroes, with 
1's along the main diagonal, however [N]
[N] will always be null, meaning the 
diagonal of 1's is not complete. I 
suspect others found this confusing as 
well, and so answered in the same way as 
I did: "D. None of the above."

The answer to this question can be seen by trying to compile the code.
There is a common error in the #define line, resulting in a syntax error only on Line-A.

This question does not ask whether the array (variable) is completely filled with known 
values (0s and 1s), including its edge, but is asking about what is *printed*.

It's a measure of how different (spread out) were the results from a
theoretically anticipated result.

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-biserial_correlation_coefficient

For example, in a MC Test you may expect 70% of people to get a particular
question right, 20% to fall for the obvious distractor, and 2 x 5%
to provide completely wrong answers.  The statistic measures whether
this distribution was roughly followed.  But we don't just assume those
values of 70/20/5/5 apply in all cases, but use the distribution of
correct responses based on all responses for the test being measured.

If 95% all get one particular answer correct, then the question was likely
too easy, and shouldn't have been asked(?).  If 95% all get an answer
wrong, then, either the question was too hard, or maybe the 'correct'
answer was incorrect after all (the wisdom of the masses).

Hi

Can someone explain why mid-sem question 20's answer is not:
C) "the value returned by fork is -1."

I believe that fork returning the value of -1 is the effect of fork system call 
failing and 'not' a reason for it to fail.

I agree, the -1 is returned precisely because it has already failed.
Hence the reason for it's failure is bound to have happened before return.

If all 3 processes become ready to be added at the exact same time, what would the

Hi Chris,

The terminal returned "Segmentation fault(core dumped)" when I tried to run my 
compiled program.
I've searched on google but none of the possible causes seems to be the case —— I did 
not use the pointer, all my arrays had enough spaces, and there was no "divide by 0" 
operation. 
I also tried -Warrey-bounds=2 to help detect the problem but nothing returns.

More interestingly, the program runs successfully after I compiled it with g++ instead 
of gcc (I was trying to use gdb to find the glitch). However, it does not help solve 
the problem.

Please advise.

The #define line holds the common error (which we often see in the labs in early weeks).

See that the preprocessor token of 'N' will be replaced by '10;' everywhere.
Trace through the code, replacing 'N' by '10;'.
Line A contains the single resulting syntax error, but errors are not raised in lines B or C.
In fact, the common error corrects line C.  Please try compiling the code.

Please see my explanation as to why it's line A and not line C.
It is a common error often seen with our early lab exercises.
I'm sorry, but the fact that many people got it wrong doesn't make it correct.

Happy to discuss this reasonably - it's not an adversarial environment - but,
to me, anonymous attacks should deserve no response.

Let's say that process number 0 *may* occur, because I know that many students are simply using the 
process number as an index into their arrays.  Similarly, we'll ensure that, say, process number 100 
won't be used (tested).

I can see that you're requiring a sentinel value to represent an idle CPU, or the process number of the 
idle process(?)  Perhaps -1 could work similarly?

There is no recommended number of local variables; how many you use will depend on what your 
program requires. Are you choosing to introduce new local variables, close to their use, rather 
than re-using previous local variables?  I believe that that's a good practice if the new 
variables have well chosen names reflecting their use.  But introducing many single character 
names, i,j,k,... has no advantage.

Does that answer your question?

This line is not doing what you think (print out the value of length, to see).
As discussed in lectures, you will need to pass the array's size as a parameter.

Also, do not define array as a pointer (unless you already know what you're doing).
Instead, define it as   array[].

That's a good question;  I don't have the answer, as it hasn't been specified as part of the 
project.  In practice, each of these 3 things would happen at slightly different physical 
times, and that would provide the ordering.  In our project, where we're only dealing with 
time at the resolution of a microsecond, the order will depend on the order that the things 
are checked in your code  (which will very likely be different in other implementations, too).

I will ensure that we don't test projects where any 2 or 3 of the above occur simultaneously.

Do you have an example tracefile that has triggered your question?

Unfortunately gcc's -Warray-bounds is not a panacea, and may work differently when combined with 
other options.  Division by zero will not produce a segmentation violation - it may produce a 
"floating point exception".  Interesting, but not surprising that a C++ compiler does or doesn't 
reveal different errors (Clang on macOS also may or may not expose the error) has each may use 
different (internal) memory sizes, making larger sizes still within memory segments that you know.

Email me the code (not an open call), and I'll report back here what type of code was causing the 
error.

The question asked "which line CONTAINS a syntax error" and not which line results in a syntax error. Line C 
did in fact contain a syntax error. Yes line A resulted in an error because of a previous error in the define 
line but line A itself has correct syntax. I feel that you stating there would be no trick questions in this

Hi Chris,

But does line C still not contain a syntax error? Line A will produce an error upon 
compilation but the question asks "which line contains a syntax error" not "which line will 
produce an (syntax) error upon compilation". I feel like those are two different questions. 
The answer to the former would be both a and c. I would appreciate your feedback.

Jackson, I am more than happy to discuss this with you, and to keep all other students informed of our discussion via the 
forum, so there's no need to complain to the EECE Department, which has nothing to do with this unit.

We clearly disagree as to whether this was a trick question, or not.  Multi-choice tests are ideally designed to have 
answers, termed distractors, which appear to be the correct answer, but are not.  The correct answers to multi-choice 
questions are not always the most obvious ones, and if the most obvious or most popular answers were always the correct 
ones, there'd be little knowledge discrimination in tests at all.

Q10 was designed to have 2 obvious distractors and, to that extent, it worked.
It was designed to test your understanding about what the C preprocessor does when performing token substitution and, as 
the question states, included a common error - an error made when using the preprocessor's actions, which then result in 
syntax errors in the preprocessed code fed from the preprocessor to the C compiler.

If each of the lines A, B, and C are considered in isolation, then C does contain a syntax error.
However, each of those lines appears with other code, which the question asks you to consider.
You were not asked to define your own question, and to consider each line in isolation.
I trust that for other questions which also required you consider some code, that you did so, and gave what you thought the 
best answer in that context, not the most obvious answer.

Hello Abdihasib,

Please also read my reply to Jackson on this.
If the question were only asking you to identify which of 3 lines was in error then, yes, it would have 
just asked:

  Which line has a syntax error?
  A) char array[N];
  B) ....

But the question does not ask that; as for all test questions, you're asked to consider the context of 
the question.

Hi Jackson,

I just thought I'd piggy back on this thread and provide another way
of looking at it. A syntax error is something that pops up at _compile
time_; that is, the error is identified during compilation. Given that the
preprocessor will substitute the value '10;' in place of the N, it does
not produce/'containt' a syntax error, because at compile time that line
of code is 'correct' syntax. This is why in the labs, I like to emphasize
that just having code that compiles does not the code is 'correct'.

Going to add on as well, unless my understanding is completely wrong fork returns -1 
after the call has already failed, just as others have said this means that fork 
returning -1 is NOT a reason for it failing, but is a result of it already failing 
which would make it impossible for it to be the reason it failed.

For a given process, you may have a number of variables that 
store different pieces of information: the time it starts,
the time it is placed on the processor, the expected global time 
it should be finished on the processor, etc. From these - and other
variables - you should be able to piece together a way of checking
to see if you have reached the time quanta.

Recently I had a problem calculating the transfer time of an i/o event. Right now my 
method to calculating these transfer times is to multiply the bytes to the power of 
six (from seconds to microseconds), then divide them by the transfer rate of the 
device (because I want an int, not float). It mostly works, but I once got a negative 
number which is concerning. It's up to a specific number that the transfer time just 
becomes a negative number. Does anyone know why this happens?

I'm not sure your translation from seconds to microseconds is correct (do you mean 10^6...?). Regardless, you should remember that there are limits to how large an integer can be, given an integer is a fixed size on your computer (nominally 32bits on most modern systems). If I have 32 bits, what is the maximum value that I can store - and are you perhaps storing a number that is too big?

Yes, I mean 10^6 (sorry if it sounded confusing). It's just that if I divide by the rate first then convert to microseconds, I end up with floating points (and I want to work with integers). 
It's the number 2210 that turns into a negative. Is there any other (maybe easier) way to calculate the transfer time?

OK, I've been waiting to hear back from another staff member's thoughts on this and the 
'decision' is that the question should have been better worded.  Fair enough.

The reason that answer D is (remains) the correct answer, and 42 students did get it 
correct, is that the fork() system call doesn't receive a parameter, so any code calling 
fork() with a parameter will not compile and, hence, couldn't be a reason for fork() 
failing because it would never run.

Of the other 3 possible answers, A and B are definitely valid reasons for fork() failing 
but, as has been clearly discussed in this thread, fork() returning -1 is an outcome of a 
failure, not a reason.

OK, so what to do about it?
42 students got the question right, so ignoring the question entirely would wrongly 
penalise those students (including some lucky few who may have guessed it!).  And for all 
other students, we don't know if they chose the wrong answer because they were confused 
by the question's wording or otherwise.

So, at the slight risk of offending those who genuinely got it right, I'll give all other 
students (with A, B, and C) the extra mark.  It'll require a bit of effort, but I'll get 
to it sometime over the weekend (so much AFL and cricket to enjoy).

Sorry for the stuff up!

Hi Chris,

Sorry if it's a dumb question. But why is that dividing by a large number(eg. 
1000000) will always result in 0.000000? 

(I was trying to convert the speed of i/o from bytes/sec to bytes/μsec which requires 
the program to operate a large division by 1000000. )

I tried different data types for the result including long double but the problem 
persists.

The problem is not related to the size of the number you're using,
but the data types involved in the arithmetic.  Ensure that you have at
least one double, such as 1000000.0, in your expression:

{{{
  double result;

  result  = 13 / 3;
  printf("%.8f\n",  result);  
  result  = 13 / 3.0;
  printf("%.8f\n",  result);  

  result  = 3 / 1000000;
  printf("%.8f\n",  result);  
  result  = 3 / 1000000.0;
  printf("%.8f\n",  result);  
}}}

Yes, you can certainly add new #define directives - they are a good way to define (and document) 
any limits that your code may have

(though I'm unsure why you need per-process device information, rather than just (the same) 
information being available to all processes).

Hi Chris,

Just seeking some clarification on how we should handle situations when the 
total_completion_time  of two or more iterations are equal with respect to the 
optimal_time_quantum.

I notice in your solution generator that when this happens, you return the largest of 
the time quantums as the optimal one. I would have thought it should return the lowest 
time quantum to avoid the system appearing sluggish.

For example:
If you run you generator with [tfD intital:100 final:1000 increment:100] your output 
is: 'best 1000 460'. Should this be 'best 300 460' instead?

Can multiple devices have the same speed? And if so how would this work in terms of 
the multiple blocked queue?

Also, can we assume that io events are listed in the order of occurrence, or can they 
be out of order?
For example, would we be expected to deal with a tracefile like so:

  i/o      100     hd      1600

Sorry, but I don't know what you're describing by 'hand-written codes'.
Could you please provide a short piece of your code that won't compile?

My only guess is that you're wanting to print the percentage sign itself, which you cannot do with 
just a single percent character in printf().  Consider:

{{{
  printf("50%\n");            // does not compile

  char percent = '%';

  printf("50%c\n", percent);  // this works, prints 50%
  printf("50%%\n");           // also works
}}}

In practice, a computer system can have multiple identical devices, such as disks, which will 
have the same speeds.  Each device is physically connected to its communication bus at numbered 
'slots', corresponding to different device addresses which (by default) will be serviced in their 
'slot' order  (so you'd place higher priority devices at lower slots).

tldr; Let's define that the order of servicing device requests is first by its priority (its 
device speed), and then by its order off appearance in the tracefile (its device number).
I'll add this to the Clarifications page - thanks.

Yes, process will appear in the tracefile in their order of creation, and I/O events within each 
process will appear in their order of being requested (time).

Hi Chris,

I have tried to compile the code and the errors I get do not align with your claims. The compiler highlights an error in the #define line and a "note" on line A. I have attached a screenshot, and I think the message it conveys is clear: the error is in the #define line.

I would liken this situation to a follow-through error in a calculation. If I incorrectly calculate the area of a circle, and then use that value for a later calculation, which line contains the error? I think most would agree it is the line where I calculated a value incorrectly, not the one where I used my incorrect value.

You may prefer to call them distractors but frankly this is a textbook example of a trick question, and it's exactly what people mean when they use the term.

Hello Jordan,

Thanks for your comment, and I appreciate that you've made the effort to type in and compile the code to support your argument.

Unfortunately, you're misinterpreting the diagnostic information being produced by gcc (which is similar to that of Apple's clang).
The first 2 lines identify the syntax error (in red), and then the following 4 lines provide a 'note', which does not identify a syntax error,
but tries to provide a better English description of what may have caused the syntax error.
See how the note follows the error reporting, and that it refers to an earlier line number.

Then observe that the last 4 diagnostic lines from gcc inform us of the syntax error because of the (now) missing definition of 'array',
and another note, not of a syntax error and unrelated to the source node, just telling us that such errors are only reported once.
This second error, 'array' being undefined, is commonly referred to as a cascading error, similar to your described 'follow-through error'.

Consider this code, where I've used 3 distinct pre-processor tokens:

{{{
#include <stdio.h>

#define N       10;
#define X       10;
#define Y       10;

void function(void)
{
    char array[N];                 // line A

    int  x = 2 * X;                // line B

    for(int i=0 ; i<Y   ++i) {     // line C
        printf("%c\n", array[i] );
    }
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    function();
    return 0;
}
}}}

When compiled on macOS using clang it similarly reports the syntax error followed by a note:

{{{
t.c:9:16: error: unexpected ';' before ']'
    char array[N];                 // line A
               ^
t.c:3:19: note: expanded from macro 'N'
#define N       10;
                  ^
1 error generated.
}}}

and on Linux (where I only have access to the very old gcc v4.4.7) it reports:

{{{
t.c: In function 'function':
t.c:9: error: expected ']' before ';' token
t.c:14: error: 'array' undeclared (first use in this function)
t.c:14: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
t.c:14: error: for each function it appears in.)
}}}

_____
The use of notes in diagnostic messages was first introduced by clang about 2010 (https://clang.llvm.org/docs/InternalsManual.html),
and their use was adopted by gcc a few years later when playing catch-up:

  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9805978
  "I have met a few folks who switched from gcc to clang mostly because of a feature like this!"

Something else you may like to try is to run the above code through *just* the C pre-processor,
with either   gcc -E t.c   or   cpp t.c
In both cases (they do the same thing) they print the output of the pre-processor to the screen (instead of passing it to the compiler).
In neither case do they report any error with the #define lines,  and you'll see the single 'future' C syntax error:

{{{
void function(void)
{
    char array[10;];

    int x = 2 * 10;;

    for(int i=0 ; i<10; ++i) {
        printf("%c\n", array[i] ); 
    }
}
}}}

Are you saying that the first error line about "']' expected before ';'" is actually talking about the array declaration?

Yes;  the output of the pre-processor for that line is:

  char array[10;];

The C compiler is expecting a ']' before it sees the first ';' .

For each process, you'll certainly need to know (record/accumulate) how much time it spends on 
the CPU, because you'll need to know when each process requests any I/O or exits.

No.  In your example, the second I/O event is requested by Process 1 as soon as that process gets 
to run after its first I/O has completed.
Both I/O events are requested after the same time spent on the CPU.


> and I would check the accumulative time with p1's process time spent on cpu?

That is exactly the only way to do it.

Yes; only one process, it requests I/O, it blocks waiting for the device to transfer the requested bytes, nothing 
for the CPU to do.

I would (confidently) hazard a guess that the students who got this question right, did not in fact get it right because they understand 
the esoteric inner workings of the compiler, but because they correctly surmised that this was indeed a trick question, and so ignored 
the obvious answer. I'm not chiming in on this because I expect the marks to be revised, I just don't think that questions like this are 
particularly edifying.

Additionally, if you have to write several detailed paragraphs - with the use of screenshots - to prove that you are correct, it actually 
furthers the claim that this is a "textbook example" of a trick question.

In addition to this, how should we handle a situation where say for example, a process has just 
finished i/o (and thus has freed up the databus) while at the same time a process on the CPU makes an 
i/o request on the ssd and there's a queue for the hd but no queue for the ssd. Should the databus 
check the device queue before or after a process on the CPU has an i/o request?

For example in the tracefile below process 1 begins and has a large i/o request on the hd, hogging it 
for a while but at the same time when the i/o transfer finishes, process 3 requests the ssd. When 
tested on the sample solution, the databus checks the queue BEFORE process 3 requests the ssd so 
process 2 gets to use the databus, but if process 3 requested the ssd first, then it would get to use 
the databus as the ssd has a higher transfer rate. What should we do if this situation arises?

I would advise against referring/internalising the C-preprocessor as 'the esoteric inner workings of the compiler',
as it is quite an essential component to understanding how to construct a correct C program.

There are least two instances above in which students now understand why their initial assumptions were incorrect; 
this question is testing your understanding of "what happens, when" during compilation (which is VERY important,
as demonstrated by the question), in addition to how preprocessor directives can be used (and abused).

Perhaps (at the ripe old age of 23) I am 'too old-fashioned' in my approach to forum discussion, 
but I find this tone to be needlessly antagonistic. The production of multiple screenshots to elaborate
on a student's query in order to ensure the student has an understanding of what is going should not be 
treated as fuel for frustration directed towards a single multiple choice question.

Having helped teach this unit (and others) for 3 years now, I find this thread is particularly disappointing in the 
lack of manners and grace associated with various posts. This is, ultimately, a help forum in which us as
teaching staff, and you as students, can help each other - not a place for needlessly negative remarks. 

[For all who read this post]
I understand this may be a difficult time during semester, and that getting something wrong or not performing
as well as you expected can be incredibly frustrating; additionally, the university has instituted a number of 
changes in recent years that have made it increasingly difficult for students to keep up with the content (as well 
as for teaching staff to deliver it). If you are having difficulties with this content, please let us know, either in the forum,
labs, lectures etc. We take no pleasure in taking marks off students, and whilst it may be difficult to tell on a 
text-based discussion, are not interested in 'proving' to students we know more than them.

I say this only to encourage students to keep posting on this forum, and for those who feel like they've been hard-done by,
or are really struggling, to reach out for a chat. We are happy to help :)

  Maybe it is, maybe it isn't - if I'm still programming in C in say, 10 years time, I might be able to agree or disagree with you given the knowledge I've 
acquired over that period. My main point was merely that if it's easier to arrive at the correct answer via educated or even total guessing vs. arriving at 
the correct answer through possessing the requisite knowledge assumed by the question writer, then maybe it's not a great question. For the record, I'm not 
saying you can really even calculate these probabilities and give a definite answer - it's just a matter of opinion, that's all.

This is true, and I am happy to take note of that. However - in my opinion - the gap in capability between the student who knows that the preprocessor will 
in fact detect the error on Line A and the student who assumes that the preprocessor will detect the error earlier where N is actually defined, is 
infinitesimally small - both are aware that the syntactical error ultimately originated from whereN was defined regardless of where the preprocessor 
detects it.
So like i said: not 'particularly' edifying. Not that I would ever argue against the acquisition of any kind of knowledge, no matter how small.

I in no way intended to contribute to any acrimonious atmosphere that was eminently palpable following the past several exchanges. I type with no ill 
feeling in my heart whatsoever, as I hope you also do. We are free to disagree, and the relationship between teachers and students should not deteriorate 
as a result.

It's unclear why you have such confidence in your guess.
As Ryan has clearly stated, the interaction between the preprocessor and the compiler is not esoteric and, at the level of this question, has been 
described in this unit.  Like another poster in this thread, you appear to believe that multi-choice tests are all about choosing the obvious answer, 
rather than the correct one, and that students should have guaranteed success by just choosing obvious answers.  I'm wondering how you classify the 
equal number of students who selected the other 2 incorrect choices. 

At the level of a 2nd year university unit, a test will not simply ask:

   Does this line have a syntax-error?   for(int i=0 ; i<N   ++i)

You should have greater confidence in the fact that there's a number of very knowledgable and interested students, who we see experimenting with this 
sort of material in lab sessions.  In lectures I stated that the C pre-processor knows very little about the C language, and that it can be used for 
other tasks, and then saw a student in the lab writing a shellscript that performed basic spelling correction/substitution on plain textfiles.

Wow! I could have simply replied "compile the code yourself to see the answer", but instead I chose to provide a detailed, hopefully helpful, answer to 
a good question, and I'm criticised for doing so?

Here, you're assuming true your own premise that students getting the question right must have guessed it.

At the risk of being accused of overstating facts simply to prove myself, there was no error for the preprocessor to detect and report;  the common 'human' error of adding 
a semicolon was not a syntactic error, and the single syntactic error resulting from this was detected by the compiler.
I'm often accused of being pedantic, but believe that using the correct terms is important.

It's difficult for us (both) to judge, but there's only about 5 students contributing to this thread, and only a couple seething and calling me every name under the sun 
(on their favourite alternate forum).  It's a shame that the question has generated such angst.  And all over 1%.

A good point;  in practice, there's no right decision, and I'm not stating that my implementation 
is (must be) the correct one.  You're correct that a longer time quantum may make (interactive) 
processes appear sluggish, while making computation-bound ones appear faster. Again, in practice, 
there is a time cost for all process switching (not in our project), and a longer time quantum 
results few context switches and less lost time.

Choosing the better time quantum would require knowledge of whether we're in an interactive or 
server-based environment - whether the device I/O was with human-facing devices (keyboards and 
screens) or block-based devices (disks) - but we don't have that specified in our project.

But one way has to be "correct" for our project, and I've implemented 'best' to be report the 
longest time_quantum resulting in the shortest total_process_completion_time.  Yes, could have 
gone the other way.

I've added a statement on this to the Clarifications page.

Yes, you will need to do something like this - else how would you know what a process wishes to do 
next, and when it exits.
Your proposal is reasonable, but it's unclear if you've considered or discarded other possibilities, 
as well.

thanks Chris, right now my conditions of when a process should be moved to event que are 
if process time spent on cpu == event's time spent of cpu and if the number of completed events < number of

would that cover most of the conditions?

The conditions/reasons that the currently running process will leave the CPU are all very well defined in lecture notes. 
Take note of the image for the 5-state model.

Also, we haven't been using the phrase 'event queue' in this project - we have a Ready Queue and a number of I/O or 
Blocked Queues (one queue for each device in our system).  Perhaps you're just referring to an array of past and future 
events belonging to each process,  but that would traditionally just be referred to as an array, not a queue, as its 
membership never changes.

A simple web search gives a number of good explanations about bus errors.
Given that it occurs in some circumstances, and no others, try to hone in on the differences between 
the two cases.  For example, is it just the presence of I/O in *the tracefile*,  or is it because 
you're trying to do/save something when you detect the presence of I/O ?

You cannot store elements with different datatypes in a single array.
Was around your problem include using more than a single array,  or converting/mapping the name of each 
device to an integer.

Strongly suggest that you watch Workshop-5, where this was discussed and solved.

does a process expiring add 5ms to the total completion time? When I run mine I always 
get the same output as the sample tracefiles with it being a state change but I don't 
think the project page mentioned it adding time. It also seems like it does on the

Hi Chris,

  I discovered that the program could be written in different ways but produce the 
same results. 
  For instance, we can either simply "calculate" the total time(which is much easier 
especially in some simple cases) or actually "simulate" each switch. The "simulate" 
approach is much more complicated as we need to keep track of every process's runtime 
state and design the structure accordingly.
  Will there be any differences in marks if we finish the project via different 
approaches? 

Cheers

No, this is an error - thanks for reporting it.
The sample solution looks for 'things to do' in its main loop, and I was incorrectly checking 
for a process exit before checking for any I/O at the same time.
Now corrected (by moving a block of code of ~5 lines).

Yes, we're only using integer values of microseconds.
However, converting 3.3333 to 4 is not rounding.
This may help:  https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help2002?hl=ceil&a=415

Such a comparison wouldn't be fair - I had an understanding of what the project was 'about', 
and wrote most of it 'in my head' while writing the project description, then wrote the code 
over an afternoon (in a very basic 'by-Week-4' way, with many comments). Since then, I keep 
tinkering with it so that its comments will address the confusion indicated in forum 
questions.

The other way to think of it is as a project over 4 weeks, during which you have 2 lectures, 
but no labsheets. So the Faculty's unit load of 10-12 hours per week suggests 32+hours in 
total, ideally more with a project partner.

There's a number of ways to do it, you've cited 2, above.
You'll need the 'concept' of priorities somewhere, though you may not need them in a separate array.
When the databus becomes available, and there's multiple processes+devices waiting to use the bus, you'll need 
the priority to determine which goes next.

There's no guaranteed path to solving it, just from your description alone, and nothing peculiar about this project that would 
make it occur.  The most likely cause is your accessing an array beyond its bounds, either with a negative index, or one >= 
the number of elements in the array.  Such errors can occur in any types of programs.

Ensure that you're compiling your program with 'cc -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -Werror....' which may identify a problem at 
compile time.  Otherwise, ensure that your arrays have been defined in terms of the correct constants, such as 
MAX_EVENTS_PER_PROCESS for your I/O events that appear to be 'triggering' the problem by their presence.

No;  approaches that are clear and their code well written are 'good' ones, others that are 
convoluted, difficult to understand, appear excessively long, etc, are not so good and will not 
earn marks (rather than lose marks).

There's no suggestion that there's only a single or correct way to write it, just that most 
students (that we hear from on the forum) have gravitated to similar ways.

need some advice on how to determine on when a process has completed its I/o event.
should I keep an array to keep track of the amount of time taken for an event to 
complete and check it with amount of time an event spends on data bus.

or I could have a variable that keeps track of the global time of when a process 
requests data bus I would check if time taken for event to complete + global time of 
when a process requests data bus == global time

not sure if either of theses two is a good approach or there is a better way of

CPU blocks high priority

If two processes both request I/O to the same device at the same time, what would

They can't both request at the same time because only the currently running process is able to request the databus. 

If another process requests the same device after that then it will stay in the blocked queue until the first process is finished with its I/O. There is no time-sharing in the databus.

While you could maintain a separate array to hold the completion times of all I/O events, it's 
probably unnecessary.  Only one process+device can be using the bus at any time, and the 
calculation of how long that will take is trivial (either when reading the file, or when I/O is 
about to commence).  A single variable or two should be all you need.

Hi,

This is a good question, but it's getting at the "noise level" of the project.
What the sample solution does, or doesn't, implement is just one possibility - there's no 
single correct answer, unless we're modelling specific physical hardware such as a bus-
arbitration circuit.

As you'll see, when released, the code in the sample solution just considers a number of 
possibilities of "what should happen next?" and, while the order of those tests makes 
sense (I hope) they could probably be swapped around if trying to model something more 
accurately.

To answer your unwritten question - don't worry about it - the tests that we'll be using 
to mark the projects will be quite simple, and not include any edge cases like you've 
described.

No upper limit, though it's stated that the whole simulation (completion time) will not 
exceed 2 billion microseconds, 2000 seconds, so that we can easily store times in a 32-bit 
integer.

That's a "dangerous" question to answer, as number of lines is a bad determination of quality, 
often misinterpreted.  But, from the sample, written to 'Week-4' standard:

variables storing data read from the tracefile - 12 lines.
variables and functions to manage the Ready Queue - 26 lines.
variables and functions to manage the I/O Blocked Queues - 82 lines.
parse_tracefile() function has grown from 64 to 85 lines.
simulate_job_mix() function has grown from 5 to 116 lines.

So what's that? About 300?

And a number of other not-required functions to generate the "pretty" output logging seen on the 
webpage.  And copious comments.

No, it takes 5usecs to jump from the Ready Q to CPU.

Are we allowed to use ceil() from math.h to round up values in the project? I ask 
this because this would require the -lm command line switch, which the markers might 
not add when marking.

Hi, just asking for a clarification on device usage.

Am I correct in saying that multiple processes cannot be using the same device at 
once?

For example if Process 1 were to start an io operation using "hd", process 2 wouldn't 
be able to start another io operation on "hd" at the same time?

When I store a positive integer value to a defined int type variable but come out as

I try long type to store the value but still negative.
What kind of data type definition should I use to store the value?

In my case my program tells me that the job mix finishes at time 605, for a total run time of 595. However, the sample solution says that execution finishes at 615 for a total run time of 605.

There was an I/O event. After 100 microseconds pass in the process, an I/O event is detected. The process moves from running to blocked and the data bus is requested for I/O. The data bus is free so it fulfills the request. This all takes 25 microseconds to compute.

Thanks for the response.
So from running -> blocked is a context switch taking 5 microseconds and a data-bus request is sent taking another 5 microseconds. Where do the other 15 microseconds come from?

The process itself became blocked because there was an I/O event ready, this event took 20ms to complete (i/o      100     hd      1600) and then allowed the process to continue. The 
other 5ms was from p1.request_databus. Only ready->running and request_databus add 5ms

If you get a number which like -2.1 billion, I think it might be happened when you calculate 
the time for io to transfer the data. You can try to print it out, like print the speed and 
bytes out to make sure you store them correctly. If you store bytes/second by a wrong way, 
then it might be 0. A number divide 0 is infinity, it is -21blablabla.

The computer system has up to 4 devices, all connected to a single databus.
Only one device can own and access the databus at any one time so, to answer your question, no - 
process-2 cannot start an I/O operation if process-1 already owns the bus.

The databus is busy from the time the highest priority process+device acquire the bus, until the time 
the data transfer finishes (calculated from the data size and data transfer rate).
A single integer holding that finishing time should be all that's required.

There's nothing complicating about tfH, other than the fact that a 2nd process has to wait for another 
to finish its data transfer.

The project only needs to support non-negative times from 0usecs to 2Billion users (2000 secs), 
which will all fit in a basic (32-bit) integer, on all computers you're likely to be using.

No need to use longs, floats, or doubles to store our times.

Hi.

just a quick question about an array.

If I have say int array[10] = {1,2,3}:

the array would be 1,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

How do I move each element to the left completely removing the first element (no wrap 
around).

I tried array[i] = array[i+1] but the 0 doesn't override the next value. So i get this

2,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

when I want

2,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There are a number of reasons, both systemic and logistic. 

The 'systemic' response is that the university is limiting the amount of money dedicated to casual teaching staff across the university, so validating an extra lab demonstrator for a unit that has an increase in student enrollments is hard enough - let alone trying to ask for more money at busy times of the semester. 

The logistic response is that we, as people who have other commitments, are all taking the labs that fit best in our schedule. Getting me to work with Daniel on the Monday labs, for example, would be a challenge because I am also teaching another unit at that time; vice versa for Daniel.

Bringing someone else just for a week in the middle of semester, and in the final week, would require bringing them up to speed on a whole project (twice) just for 4-8 hours of work (it does still take us time to familiarise ourselves with the project materials, too).   

On top of this, postgraduate research students, who make up the bulk of the CS casual teaching staff, are limited by the university of working 8 hours a week, due to the fact that we are often on a government scholarship (and therefore being paid to work at least 30 hours a week exclusively on research). 

TL;DR - We would love to able to provide more support to students; unfortunately, we are limited in our ability to do so. Please do not assume we are unkind, or unaware of the difficulties faced in the last week of a project submission.

Seems like just a simple programming problem - I'd check the bounds of your 'for' loop, obviously 
the second 3 is not being overwritten by its following 0.

Thanks for spotting this - have proof-read it about a thousand times!

The final exam contributes 40%,  so we have 20, 20, 20, and 40.

Unsure of what you want by 'extent', but 2/20 marks for the project:

  for being descriptive, clear, useful, not pointless (x = 0;  // clear variable x)

The comments in our sample Labsheet solutions are considered 'good'.

The seg error was of course due to illegal indexing of an array, but this occurred further 
down in my code, past the print line that never happened. Not sure why it never printed, 
but when I added a \n character at the end of that line it did print, and showed that the

The lack of (the delay of) output via printf() is because the output, to the screen, is line-buffered.  
Its output is only forced/flushed to the screen when it encounters a newline character, or if its 
buffer fills up.

If you need to print stuff without a newline, you can force it to be flushed with:

    printf("look, no newline");  fflush(stdout);

or you could add  setbuf(stdout, NULL);  in your main() function to disable all line-buffering.

Solved it, It was something outside the array I was doing wrong with other functions.

Say time quantum 300 and 400 both return the same optimal completion time, does it 
matter what quantum we return since they both have the same result?

hey Chris I know that it is posted on project description that 20/40 will be awarded only 
if the solution gets correct answer but could you clarify it more say I'm not getting 
correct answer with I/o's so does that mean I'll be given 0 out of 20 percent just because 
I haven't get the correct answer.

You probably shouldn't do that. fopen() by default doesn't expect a file extension. Just a file containing text. This makes requiring a file extension somewhat redundant.
The sample tracefiles we're given also don't specify a particular format by default, so I think it would just be an unnecessary
thing to implement given the scope of the project. Hope it helps.

I can't see where the project description says the above.
Your project will be tested against 8-10 different tracefiles, each contributing 1, 2, or 3 marks 
depending on their difficulty.  You'll appreciate from the example trace files that getting the 
process's ordering is very important,  but that there's a number of different cases (orderings) for 
I/O, which will be tested with different examples.  You may get the easier ones correct, but not the 
harder ones.

(unfortunately, though, no marks awarded for using punctuation)

Yes, it's possible (and permitted) but it's more difficult.
Instead of using:

   CLOCK += 1;

you might code something like:

   CLOCK += determine_time_increment_to_next_global_event();

where you've just moved a lot of the calculation outside of the loop.

The project, actually its call to fopen(), does not require any particular filename or filename 
extension.  If your (downloaded?) tracefiles have a '.txt' extension, it's only because your browser 
added the extension.

A wide range of the number of processes, the number of devices, the number and types of I/O 
events, and the amount of scheduling overlap.

It depends;
you should be able able to 'solve' the simple examples - one or few processes, including ones overlapping in their 
execution - those ones you should be able to get the timing exact.

But examples with many processes, performing I/O to different devices, overlapping in time are clearly more difficult, 
and the marking for each example will have some/more leniency.
That's why the test examples are worth different amounts.

Leave the code in so that the markers can see that you've attempted it.

Ensure that it compiles, and runs, even if unsuccessfully (incorrect timings).
Far better that it runs incorrectly, than crashes.

Too difficult to answer until the markers have seen it.
You do not lose (sp.) marks,  you simply do not earn them.

Hi Chris,

I have a couple questions regarding the second 20 marks awarded for the project. You have already mentioned that 2 of the 20 come from commenting code, are you able to divulge how the other marks are allocated?

Also, is it safe to assume we be marked for readability of our program? If so, is there any coding standard you suggest we follow?

Roughly equal marks for all of the qualities stated on the project question sheet:

    your programming style, including your use of meaningful comments, well
    chosen identifier names, appropriate choice of basic data-structures
    and data-types, and appropriate choice of control-flow constructs.

It appears that you're attempting to micro-manage your time or
effort. With about 6-8 already stated qualities being assessed, it should
be clear that they will provide 2-3 marks / 20 for each.


> Also, is it safe to assume we be marked for readability of our program? If so, is there any coding standard you suggest we follow?

Safe to assume? It's stated:

    Preference will be given to well presented, well documented solutions that
    use the appropriate features of the language to complete tasks in an easy
    to understand and easy to follow manner. That is, do not expect to receive
    full marks for your project simply because it works correctly. Remember,
    a computer program should not only convey a message to the computer,
    but also to other human programmers.

No single coding standard, but all Laboratory sheet and Workshop solutions
are considered to be of a good and consistent style.

A data size of 3000bytes transmitted at 30000bytes/sec takes 0.1secs, 100000usecs, well within 
the range of a standard 32-bit integer.

Hi Chris,
I found that in the sample test G and H, under the any time quantum, the first I/O appears 
to be incorrect result. For example, in tfG, the first i/o takes 2100 space, and the device 
speed is 30000 bytes/sec, then it should be 70000 microseconds. But in the sample test 
website, at 100 time quantum, it is 68495 microseconds. Did I missed any thing important 
about the first i/o? This question appears in both G and H, and only for the first i/o.
Cheers

When I run the sample with tfG, the first I/O is requested at 750usecs, takes 5usecs to acquire the bus, 
and it finishes at 70755usecs.

I can't see any reference to 68495 at all.

Hello people,

I'm afraid I have got myself into a significant bind. 
I shall spare you the time and just say that for various reasons - all originating 
with myself - I have completed exactly none of the project... I am very new to C and 
I have found that the topics have moved much too fast for me - or: I have not kept 
up... probably some of both. 

Needles to say; I don't expect to do very well. I would like to hand in a project 
that can at least store the relevant information in various arrays.

can someone please just give me a super quick rundown of how to store a given 
element in a 2D array. 

I have found the workshop wherein Chris showed us how to do what I am asking very 
helpful - that was the one where we parsed up a logfile - but even that went too far 
over my head for me to be able to create an analogous program for this project. 

I can store the device names and process times but I am stuck on the part where he 
writes a find_ops() function to store the file operations as integers in a 1D array 
- I can't translate that function into an analogous function to store the I/O 
events.  

perhaps I'm a lost cause at this point but I would really appreciate any guidance 
whatsoever on this topic.

Thanks,

Fraser

In order to know when to go from BLOCKED -> READY I've created a variable called

I initialize blocked_time above my while-loop in simulate_job_mix to have 0 in every spot

I change blocked_time just once in my code where I set it equal to time.

I have tried to recreate priority for the devices and it looks like I've done everything 
right. When I try my own cases it also works fine for multiple io devices. But I am 
struggling to recreate the sample that was provided on the actual project page. Have anyone 
tested it with the tester website?

Hello Fraser,

An equivalent function to find_ops(), for our project, would be find_device() - instead of 
storing a character string for every device name used in every process's I/O operations,  it's a 
lot easier to store just the device number to be used.

Then, all of the details about every I/O operation are (3) integers - time, device-number, and 
size.

In this project we are not at all worried about the running speed of your simulation,  but 
integers are 'always' easier to deal with than character strings.  We can trivially perform 
operations such as == and < with integers,  but for strings we need to call functions such as 
strcmp().  That's our motivation for 'getting rid of' device names as soon as possible, and just 
working with integers   (and, yes, they are faster).

Hope this helps,

Im struggling to make my code with with processes that overlap, currently when it detects a 
process on the running variable it runs that process for its remaining running time or the 
length of the time quantum adding that time to the clock.

This causes the clock to jump more than 1 micro second in some cases, therefore any process 
that would have been added to the ready que are not detected because they are skipped.

Im not sure how to fix this and have been spending a lot of time on it.

If you use that method, you could create a function that takes the parameter of the starting 
time, and the time to be consumed by running that process... By doing so, that function could run 
a loop on checking whether any processes (that hasnt been added yet to to the queue). If that 
process being run is in the RANGE of starting and ending (starting + time consumed). Then you 
could add that from NEW->READY

Hi Chris,

I've got a few questions regarding readability and code lay-out.

Firstly, is there such a thing as too many comments? Will we lose marks for over-
commenting?  I plan to comment on as many things as possible, even if it seems 
redundant (rather not risk it). 

Secondly, if I have some operations I need to perform on my data structures that 
are not directly related to the simulation (such as maybe re-arranging devices to 
sort by speed), are we expected to write them as separate functions or can we just 
do everything under the simulate_job_mix function?

Thirdly, do we lose marks for declaring the same variable repeatedly in for loops? 
for example, I sometimes need to do 2 for loops consecutively (for different 
operations) so I have:

for( int i=0 ; i<x ; ++i;)
{
   
   ....
}

...

for( int i=0 ; i<x ; ++i)
{
   ...
}

Thanks!

Doesn't matter which format - just be consistent. 

Re: over-commenting, I think there is stuff in the help forum with some 
explanations on what is/isn't necessary. e.g. 

int x = 1; //Assign 1 to x 

Is unnecessary. Please don't get in the habit of doing this. 

Rule of thumb would be comment on what your functions are doing, what your loops are trying to achieve etc. If your code has more comments than code, then that is more of a sign of unintelligible (and therefore poorly written) code, than a sign of 'good commenting'. 

TL;DR - Everything In Moderation.

What value does such a comment add?
What (possibly) else could such a named variable be used for, unless it's very badly named?

Don't add any more comments than would be helpful, lest there becomes too many of them, and people give up on reading them.

My belief - don't use them unless their use can be justified or cannot be avoided.
I can't imagine why a goto statement would be essential in this project.
No way around using it?

As the project sheet says -

Since we haven't learnt pointers yet you aren't expected to pass by reference. Using 
global variables should be fine.

I assume it'll be different for everyone, depending on how you're using the goto statements. 
I was using to to always check for actions which can be done asynchronously, which I moved 
to a separate function which I was able to call whenever needed.

Hope that helps.

To be a little pedantic here C is never pass by reference. It is always pass by value, it just so happens that pointers are references to a memory location.

From: poster037@student.uwa.edu.au
X-smilie: none

Hi, I have a question about the sample program simulation. It seems as though the transfer 
time calculated for a given IO event is incorrect. Here is an example:

I use this trace file
# two processes, both compute and perform several I/O operations,
# all I/O using the same I/O device:
#
device	floppy	30000 bytes/sec
#
reboot
#
process 2 240 {
	i/o	200	floppy	300
	exit	300
}
#
process 5 280 {
	i/o	200	floppy	300
	exit	300
}

See that process 2's IO has 300 bytes. Am I right in saying the total transfer time (time 
spent on the databus) is 10000 microseconds?
If we compare this to the time spent on the bus in the simulation:

@00000660   p5.RUNNING->BLOCKED(floppy)                                           
(running=__  RQ=[]  nexit=0)
@00010560   p2.release_databus,  p2.BLOCKED(floppy)->READY,  p5.request_databus   
(running=__  RQ=[2]  nexit=0)

You can see that process 5 spent 10560 - 660 = 9900 microseconds on the bus... Is the 
sample solution wrong?

You're looking at the wrong process. Process 5 was blocked at 660 but it was process 2 that 
released the data bus at 10560. Process 5 releases the databus at 20565

What exactly does your calculation involve? Perhaps you are accessing a negative index from an 
array or the array itself has been assigned a wrong value somewhere. It's hard to tell without 
seeing the code.

Likely too late, the second approach is preferred.

While the amount of code generated will be nearly identical, the first approach requires 
the functions to be called multiple times - generally not preferred because the functions 
may take a 'long' time to calculate their identical (deterministic) result (probably not in 
this case), so we'd hope to avoid this waste of time.

We also can't tell if the execution of function1() has a side-effect that may modify 
function2()'s result.  Someone reading your 1st approach may be confused whether 
function1() or function2() is evaluated first.

Yes, but your projects won't be tested with examples anywhere near MAX_EVENTS_PER_PROCESS, 
which is probably why you're asking.  Most implementations we've seen maintain separate 
array(s) to hold each process's exit time.

insight. For me, it was because to transfer 2210 when I was calculating the time required, I was 
multiplying 2210 * 1,000,000 it would be (2,210,000,000) more than the positive limit of int 
(2,147,483,647), therefore, it folds to negative number. On other situations, it is usually 
within the limits of int. To overcome this I would recommend to use some other data type or 
splitting multiplication to multiplication and division.

To date, there are 223 project submissions (117 by individuals and 106
in teams of two).  Of those 31, had to be edited before they could compile  
(never previously been compiled under macOS?).  12 could not be compiled
even after significant modification  :-(

We hope to have them marked within 2 weeks.
There are still a number of students with Faculty-approved extensions,
so the sample solution's code will be released at the end of this week.

I'd also welcome any feedback you have on the 1st project, via a quick
survey that will take only 3 minutes, or a little longer if you wish to
leave comments or suggestions:

Reinforcing the idea from the subject of targeted advertising, people who views this fake news 
will be exposed to more fake news due to the algorithm of matching topics with the same point of 
view or category as the user which further amplifies the spread of the fake news.

(It has turned out that) Q1 is a good revision question for a number of students who may not 
have tried the Luhn credit-card algorithm from Labsheet-2.

Q1 is probably a good question for first attempting a solution that indexes into an array of 
characters, and then takes an identical approach, but using pointers.

None of the other questions really lend them to a solution specifically requiring pointers.

But Labsheet-5, however, plenty of pointers!

Strange to think a computer algorithm has the power to amplify our hatred, sympathy and apathy on a

What's the solution? Regulate social network companies, or build an open source alternative that is non-
hostile to users? How could open source ever compete with the social media tech giants?

I seriously doubt an open-source alternative could ever be successful for psychological as opposed to technical reasons. Social media platforms are designed to push our cognitive buttons in such a way as to keep us coming back for more. This typically involves feeding us with a constant stream of people and things that agree with our views about the world. The ethics of this are obviously quite murky and I don't think would stand up to the level of scrutiny that open source projects are held to. Open sourcing I imagine would probably also lead to a great deal of fragmentation that wouldn't allow dominant platforms to emerge. Don't like a feature? Fork the repo and make your own version. This may be seen in the number of flavours of linux that are floating around. Just my $0.02

Hi,

I am a little confused regarding the address locations with memory management.

I understand what an absolute address is, and correct me if I am wrong, the relative 
address is assigned to a process before placement, then it will be an absolute address? 

I don't quiet understand fully the logical address. And the roles specifically of the base 
and bounds on each process.

I believe the bounds register controls the size of the process. However, I am not sure what 
the base registers role is in the placement of addresses.

Thanks.

Hi,

I know what pointers do in the sense of pointing to a memory address of another variable. 
However, I don't understand the concept of using them.

If I have:
int a;
int *p; 
a = 5;
p = &a

Why not just have 2 variables like so.

int a;
int b;
a = 5;
b = a;

Obviously changing the value of pointer p will change the variable result of a? Or changing 
the value of a will change the value of p to what a is now.

I don't get the real roots of why to use pointers. I just can't get my head around them. 
seems like b = a is the same as the *p assigned to address of a.

Thanks

A relative address is an address relative to some known starting point, such as the beginning of a 
process's code.
Independent of where a process is placed in global/physical memory, a relative address will not 
change because we only think of it as the offset from some starting point, and we don't generally 
discuss (or case about) that starting point.

Simplistic memory management schemes will choose a location (sequence of bytes) for a process, and 
copy the process's code and data there, and then it will never move.

More complex schemes will enable the process's location to move over time, during the lifetime of the 
process.

However, by using a relative address (relative to something that *may* change), we can still talk 
about a process's data, etc, without worrying if and where it may have moved in global/physical 
memory.

You're correct that, in the small examples you've used, there seems little point.
Hopefully their use, and advantage, will become clearer when you see them used with dynamic memory 
allocation, and the creation of dynamic data-structures.

Perhaps review the swap() example from our lecture material, and start reading Chpt.22 from C Notes For 
Professionals (free download).

If all you are doing is using rand() to generate a number, and then applying a modulo operator 
to that number, e.g.:

    int rand = rand() % 52

This will definitely produce a value between 0 and 52, but there is no guarantee that if you 
do this 52 times, you will get different numbers (in fact, it is probably likely you will get 
overlap). 

My advice would be instead of randomly generating numbers between 1 and 52, and then using 
that as your deck, create an 'unshuffled' deck of cards (maybe as an array?). Then, shuffle 
those cards within the deck. 

Hope this helps!

Just a small correction to Ryan's post.

Calling int value = rand() % 52, will give you values between 0 and 51, inclusive, and each call to rand() 
is considered an independent event, so you will very likely get repeated values if you only call it 52 
times in total.

Consider the physical situation that you're trying to model.
Assuming that you already had a shuffled deck of cards, you could choose a random card print/announce it, 
and then either put it back in the deck (allowing it to be seen again), or put it aside (so that it 
won't be seen again).  We want the second case - so you'll need a mechanism (code and data) to remember the 
cards you've already seen, so that they're not seen again.

Yes, that's exactly what you do  (though I wouldn't have used the word 'simplify'),  and then 
the 2 additional parts to test your Makefile, and add a new 'clean' target.

(So as to help others) can you please explain what in the current wording of the exercise is

Available later today (I, too, have other things to do everyday!)

I can't say if you'll find the project more or less difficult.
It's covering a different topic, which you may enjoy more, or enjoy less, and you have more 
experience than you had 5 weeks ago - you will benefit from that experience, and the project will 
be able to exploit that experience.

I'll be at UWA during the break, it's not a holiday for anyone, it's just a week without lectures 
and labs. (someone once said it's a non-teaching week, not a non-learning week).
Yes, use the help forum, or email me for an appointment in my office if you need to see me.

I've written the array version of strcat(), but the manual states the function should return a pointer. After further reading and testing, it seems it's not possible to work around this with only arrays.

1. Functions are allowed to return pointers ... returning array of character is technically allowed (recall that whenever an array is called, a 
pointer referring to the first element [0] of that array is called, and any subsequent indices of that array are just a relative distances to the 
address pointed by the pointer see ). There is no syntax to return character array, but returning character pointer is the same thing  

See http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/lectures/lecture15/06.html for more details <b> "an array's name is synonymous with the address of 
the first element of that array"</b>

example: This function returns a Previously, <b>CHARACTER POINTER</b>
{{{
char *strcpy_pointer( char *dest, char *src ) // two pointer parameters
{
    char *origdest = dest;  // take a copy of the dest parameter

    while( *src != '\0' ) {
        *dest = *src;       // copy one character from src to dest
        ++src;
        ++dest;
    }
    *dest = '\0';

    return origdest; // returns a copy of the original destination parameter
}
}}}

2. Global variables are not a good workaround as it will clutter the whole code along with having the inflexibility of not being able to pass other 
variable/pointer to functions which leads to modularization. One advantage of modularization is that you could always pass different values to the 
function even if the argument is of different name... which cannot be done if it is hard-coded with global variables.

Imagine this, what if I have a string var named MESSAGE, and I make it a global variable. Now, I want to concatenate something to it... If I make a 
function mystrcat(char BEINGAPPENDED) which appends something to MESSAGE as a global variable. Now, WHAT IF, I have a new string var named TITLE, and 
I want append something to it, do I have to create mystrcat2 ( a new strcat to concatenate only for global var TITLE)??? No, we don't want that, we 
want code reuse to happen.

About strcat(), it returns a pointer of the destination which is also the first parameter of the function. NOTE: <b> STRCAT DOES NOT DO ANY MEMORY 
ALLOCATION. IT SIMPLY ASSUMES THAT THE DESTINATION IS BIG ENOUGH TO ALLOW CONCATENATION</b> If you do not heed this warning, you will encounter a 
SEGMENTATION FAULT as the function will try to change the contents of the memory block after the supposed limit of the string.

Interesting that you've been able to make it that far (almost complete) without knowing where you were 
heading!

You don't *compile* a Makefile.  A Makefile is a specification or configuration file for the 'make' 
utility program - it tells 'make' what actions it should perform.

Assuming your C files and your Makefile are in the same directory,
try just executing:

  prompt>. make

!?

Pretty confident that it's because your action lines (the indented ones) are indented with spaces, 
when they should be tabs.

Ah thank you, that was the problem. Funnily enough VS Code doesn't insert a tab when you press the tab key (it 
just inserts several spaces). I had to copy and paste instead.

It will be a configurable setting - look for phrases like 'soft tabs' or 'hard tabs' in its preferences.

Hi, when I try to makefile with the files given in lecture12(calcmarks), it shows up with 
this error:

Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:

clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
make: *** [calcmarks] Error 1

the command I typed in was:make calcmarks

Any idea what I did wrong?
Thanks.

I want to ask a question about the project before we could start coding. 

So apparently we're required to make a "library" that contains functions that involve 
the "SIFS volume" (I think they're provided in the description). There's no main 
function so we can't execute it directly. We would eventually link them all together 
by a makefile.

We make the library and functions ... but I'm confused if there's supposed to be more 
to this. Are we supposed to link the library to other programs in order for them to 
access an SIFS volume; and if so, will there be sample solutions for this? Sorry if 
this sounds a little vague.

Thank you.

Not vague; quite a reasonable question.

Yes, you'll be building the API's functions and placing them into a library but, of course, 
they'll need testing.  So you'll also need to write some quite short programs to test your 
functions  (though these don't need to be submitted, and won't be marked).

For example, the first API function is SIFS_mkvolume() and, in the 'starter files' will be the 
sifs_mkvolume.c  program, that looks like this:


{{{
#include <stdio.h>
#include "sifs.h"

void usage(char *progname)
{
    fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s volumename nblocks blocksize\n", progname);
    fprintf(stderr, "or     %s nblocks blocksize\n", progname);
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}

int main(int argcount, char *argvalue[])
{
    char        *volumename;
    uint32_t    nblocks;
    size_t      blocksize;

    if(argcount == 3) {
        volumename      = getenv("SIFS_VOLUME");
        if(volumename == NULL) {
            usage(argvalue[0]);
        }
        nblocks         = atoi(argvalue[1]);
        blocksize       = atoi(argvalue[2]);
    }
    else if(argcount == 4) {
        volumename      = argvalue[1];
        nblocks         = atoi(argvalue[2]);
        blocksize       = atoi(argvalue[3]);
    }
    else {
        usage(argvalue[0]);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    if(SIFS_mkvolume(volumename, nblocks, blocksize) != 0) {
        SIFS_perror(argvalue[0]);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
}}}

You compile this program and then link it with your library, using a command similar
to that given in the 'Examples of use' section on the webpage.

Hi, I am not actually sure whatsup, but from my experience working with makefile.
you just go to the specific directory and type >>"make"

could you please send right here the makefile you're trying to run? Maybe its just some silly 
spacing error

They are different files, located in different directories.

Both the library's API functions and user-testing-programs require. sifs.h. (in the upper directory),
but only the library functions need access to the concrete volume structure. in  sifs-internal.h. (in the lower 
library directory).

Want to find a friend to handle the second project together.
The 1st project was almost exploded my mind and I realized it's really necessary to have a

English as a second language (while if you wanna learn a new language...it's a good opportunity)
Live near campus(5 minutes to Reid)
My schedule is flexible.

Yes; each volume is a file, though not a text file, and so you'll need to first open it with fopen() or open() before 
you can modify it.

See the provided code in library/mkvolume.c for an example.

(I will let Chris answer this.)
Would it be possible, for future posts on this forum, to format and proof-read your posts?
It is easier for us to answer a post with multiple questions if they are separated
as such; it is not a problem asking multiple questions in one post, just better if 
they are written as complete sentences/paragraphs as opposed to a stream-of-consciousness.
Additionally, given this is a forum (as opposed to the Discord chat system being used
by students elsewhere), it is courteous to present queries in a manner similar to 
an email, than a quick IM to a friend.

Please don't let this discourage you from posting; a little effort initially will go a long way to helping us help you, that's all. 

Cheers, 
Ryan.

A data-block has no fixed format, its contents are just header.blocksize characters long,
so you can just introduce a character array when you need one.

It's not feasible to define a new generic datatype for a data-block (and that's why I've not defined one in the provided header files),
because we don't know how large each data-block needs to be until we've read a specific volume's header.

There are many times you'll need to find a specific or any directory, file, or an unused block, and the bitmap records the current use of each block.

> > question.2- there is an array one_block[blocksize] what is it actually doing?

There is a variable:  char oneblock[blocksize]
but it's only a local variable in the function SIFS_mkvolume()
It's just a local variable performing the role as in my answer, above.

Function parameters named 'volumename' refer to the name of the single-file holding the SIFS volume on your macOS or Linux disk.
Function parameters named 'pathname' refer to a directory of file *inside* the SIFS volume.

Hi, I had a few questions about the project:

1. Do we change the modtime of a dir_block when something happens "within" it 
   (i.e. a file/subdir is deleted, created). And if so does this even extend to 
   the case when a file/subdir within a subdir is created/deleted, where the changed
   modtimes propagate up the directory heirarchy?

2. Does the mod time of a file_block ever change, if for example there are two 
   identical files and the first is deleted, should the modtime change to reflect the
   second's creation time?

3. When we make changes to the volume, would it be safe to assume we could read the 
   whole volume into memory at once, or would we have to allow for the possibility
   the file is very large and read/write piece by piece.

4. What is the convention for the volume paths passed to the library functions, 
   for example is it like the shell, with a preceding slash:
	del_file(/1stSubDir/2ndSubdir/file1") vs
	del_file("1stSubDir/2ndSubdir/file1") 
   and do directories need to end with a slash or anything special:
	rmdir("/1stSubDir/2ndSubdir/")	

5. Do you need to worry about failed writes to the volume, maybe by copying it before
   writing to it, to avoid destroying the user's volume?

Thanks for the help,

I have some questions regarding the parameters of the functions. I know what volumename is for; I assume that pathname 
refers to a directory within that volume. But I'm not sure what the significance of the other parameters are. 

Are the parameters of functions dirinfo() and fileinfo() referring to the contents of the directory and file blocks? I see 
that some parameters are entrynames and modtime, so I assume that's what it's referring to. But I'm confused as to why 
they're parameters (I thought they were what we're looking for).

I'm not sure what the parameters data and nbytes are for. Can someone explain what the significance of them is?

Also, where do we store (I don't know if "store" is the right word) the directory and file blocks in the volume? Is the 
bitmap related to what we're looking for, and do we need to use fwrite()?

A great set of questions;  you've obviously been thinking things through....

A directory may hold up to SIFS_MAX_ENTRIES (=24) entries.
Only set or change the modtime when anything is added or deleted from that set of 24.
Do not change the modtime when any of those 24 changes - no propagation of times upwards to any 
parent directory.
This is consistent with the file-systems on contemporary OS platforms.

No. The modtime of a file-block is only set once, when the first file is added to the block.
All filenames added later (arguably, the same file) do not update the modtime.

No, don't assume that it'll all fit in memory.
It's easy to imagine/construct a volume much larger than available RAM (or VM).

The two forms are the same, with or without the leading '/' each subdirectory or file is 
located within or below the top-level root directory (always at block 0).
There is no notion of relative pathnames (without a leading '/') as there's no equivalence of 
the current-working-directory, as processes cannot 'cd' into a volume.

 
> 5. Do you need to worry about failed writes to the volume, maybe by copying it before

No, not required, though it would be a simple matter to only save (in memory) the blocks that 
are being changed (the number of which are quite small), and then write-back these saved blocks 
in the event of a problem.  No need to backup the whole volume before changes.

It's also very difficult to determine *why* a write may have failed, so the most likely source 
of an error is not the disk, itself, failing, but an error in the coding of the library.

They are parameters to some functions because that's how the functions pass-back their results to the caller.
Consider the parameters to the money() function of Labsheet-5.  The first parameter can be described as an input parameter, which passes 
a value to the function.  The other two parameters, addresses, enable the money() function to pass two results back to the caller.
The same is true for dirinfo() and fileinfo() - the volumename and and pathname are input parameters,  and the remaining parameters 
enable the functions to pass back multiple values to the caller.
 

> I'm not sure what the parameters data and nbytes are for. Can someone explain what the significance of them is?

Same story for writefile() and readfile() - data refers to a file's contents to be written or read, bytes refers to its length.
Very similar to your OS's write() and read() system-calls.

Directory-, file-, and data-blocks all occupy the general "blocks" of the volume, of which there will be hundred or thousands. The 
bitmap maintains a record of what each block is currently being used for.

rmdir() does not do its work recursively;  success requires the directory to be empty.


So....
Ouch, I forgot an error case!
I've added to SIFS_ENOTEMPTY (=13) to sifs.h and library/perror.c

All students can either take a full copy of the  sifs-files.zip
distribution, or just add a single lines to each of the above two files.

It all depends on how you implement things - will you choose a global variable for your bitmap, or local 
ones for each function?   (don't answer here).

[maybe a hint, unsure] will your library be able to support a single program accessing two SIFS volumes 
at once, by alternating between their names, or won't that be an issue?

Ok thank you. So what you're implying is that we should keep all variables local to 
functions so that we can call the library functions for different volumes in the same 
program.
That means when writing our library functions we should find which blocks are available 
(and all other details of its state that we may need) by reading the volume itself not by 
having variables that store its state?

Think my question was cut off...
It’s contents was “,du...u2ê]”  Can we read this in our functions to determine the state of the volume? I am 
inferring ‘,’ represents the volume header block, the ‘d’ is the root directory block, the ‘u’s are the unused 
blocks but what are the characters at the end? I notice when making new volumes the first character, in this case 
2, changes...

Not implying that, specifically;  just that there are a number of ways to arrange the ways that your 
API functions share their knowledge (variables), if they need to.

All details are held in each volume, and its only the volume that persists between different 
invocations of the SIFS_* programs - when processes terminate, their state (variables) is no longer 
accessible.

Different volume fields have different data types;  as we saw in the Workshop, use
od -i volume,  od -c volume,  etc, to quickly see what's in there.

Hi Chris,

I was just wondering how we are supposed to interpret/read the volume files. I've 
been looking at/testing the sifs_mkvolume file and I've been having trouble finding a 
way to read the file and interpret its contents as it seems to just be filled with 
gibberish every time and there is no consistency to them. E.g. "{duuuuuuuuqie} with 
the i and e having accents on them. 

Any clarification on this would be much appreciated.

Hi, I haven't started coding yet, but I can tell you about how I've approached the 
project so far.

Firstly, I think if you haven't completed lab 5, its a good idea to do it, or at least 
go and read the tasks and look carefully at the suggested solution. There are parts of 
lab 5 marked as [project] that were very helpful for me in understanding Project 2.

I have also printed off the project 2 makefile and header and have labelled parts of 
it to help me understand they're doing. I had to do a bit more research to understand 
some new concepts here. 

I've had a play around with executing the project Makefile and using the 
SIFS_makevolume function. Now, I've just watched the workshop from Friday, which 
helped me understand more (especially the concept of the new volume as a new usb that 
needs to be formatted).

Now I'm going to go print off SIFS_makevolume code and write notes on the paper so I 
understand it better because it seems fundamental to how the other functions will 
work. After that I think I might decide what's the best function to work on first and 
start on that.

I hope that helps.

If you're having difficulty understanding the format of our SIFS volumes, the web-based 
volume viewer:

   https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/sifs-viewer

may help. You may view a few sample volumes (I'll add to these soon), and upload your own 
volumes to view their contents.

The validation of uploaded volumes isn't finished yet, so you may be able to crash the 
application with malformed volumes.

Questions and feedback welcome.

hey Chris I found two different signatures of the same method in the file where one 
says 
int SIFS_dirinfo(const char *volumename, const char *pathname,char ***entrynames, uint32_t 
*nentries, time_t *modtime)

while other one looks like this 
the first one use 2d array named entry names and second one used just entrynames so which 
one to use

int SIFS_dirinfo(const char *volumename, const char *pathname ,char **entrynames, uint32_t 
*nentries, time_t *modtime)

In which files did you find the 2 signatures?
The triple-pointer for the entry names is the correct one.

library/dirinfo.c defines the (unfinished) function

  int SIFS_dirinfo(const char *volumename, const char *pathname,
                 char ***entrynames, uint32_t *nentries, time_t *modtime)

which matches its declaration in  sifs.h  (else, it wouldn't all compile cleanly).

The sifs_dirinfo.c program passes the address of a double pointer to the function 
SIFS_dirinfo() with:

    if(SIFS_dirinfo(volumename, pathname, &entrynames, &nentries, &modtime) != 0) {
        SIFS_perror(argvalue[0]);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

Passing the address of a double-pointer means that the function receives/uses a triple 
pointer.  The function needs to allocate memory for the calling function, and pass back the  
address of that allocated memory.

So there's no contradiction in the declaration, definition, nor use
(else, again, it wouldn't all compile cleanly).

That code is a function *declaration* - which only announces the existence of a function.  It is not a 
function *definition* - which would provide the implementation of the function.

We typically place function declarations in header files, here in sifs.h, so that other code can call 
the functions, knowing the number and datatypes of the parameters,  but without having to have access 
(or understand) the implementation of the function.

Aside from the fact the line, above, begins with the 'extern' keyword,  you can tell it's a 
declaration because the line ends with a semi-colon,  rather than using a '{' to open a code block to 
commence the function's definition.

The implementation of that function already exists in  library/mkvolume.c -
it's code that I've given you to get an idea of how to access our volumes.

The other API functions are also declared in sifs.h and with their incomplete implementations in C 
source files in the library/ directory,  but you'll need to complete their implementation.

Reading information from the volume is, of course, very similar to writing it to the volume.
Have you looked at the provided code in. library/mkvolume.c. ?

Hello Michael,

I may be confused by your question,
but both variables are already defined as members of the SIFS_VOLUME_HEADER,
defined in the file  library/sifs-internal.h

Have a look at library/mkvolume.c  to see how the structure is used.

No;  physically in a volume the very first bytes are used to store the header,
the physically next bytes will be used to store the bitmap,
and then all remaining bytes in the volume store each of the blocks (each block is one of 4 
types).

The standard memset() function fills the unblock[] array with zero-bytes, and then memcpy() 
copies the contents of rooter_block[] into oneblock[].

In C you cannot simply assign one array to another (with =) so you need to 'physically' copy 
the contents of one array into the other (we saw this is strcpy() and our use of queues in 
the 1st project).

However, the arrays oneblock[] and rootdir_block[] are different datatypes, so you 
"shouldn't" really be able to assign one to another.  But C to the rescue - memcpy() simply 
and quickly copies the bytes from source to destination, allowing up to store the contents of 
rootdir_block[] into oneblock[].  And, by design, rootdir_block[] is smaller than oneblock[], 
so it will fit.

Think of oneblock[] as a generic block of data, which can have 4 different uses.

You may just be using the wrong wording, here, but
bitmap[] is an array, each element of which is of the datatype SIFS_BIT.

For blocksize the project outline says it is usually "1KB or 4KB", and we have a 
SIFS_MIN_BLOCKSIZE of 1024. I was wondering if we could get a SIFS_MAX_BLOCKSIZE 
constraint, since size_t can be a very large number.

nblocks, also does not have a max constraint. I could understand if this is implicitly 
constrained to the max uint32_t number.

I hope this cleared up my question.

Hi Michael,

Yes, thanks.

I don't believe there needs to be an upper-bound on either value -
if someone wishes to have a very large volume with many blocks or a large blocksize, then the OS 
will impose its constraints if it doesn't have sufficient disk-space or available RAM. Any program 
'hitting' these limits (at runtime) should detect them and fail gracefully.

Is there a technical reason you think there needs to be upper-bounds?

(politely, again) not values, but datatypes.

They are defined in the standard header files  stdint.h  and  time.h,
which are both #included from  sifs.h
so no need to do anything other than use them.

A directory block has a size of one block. Remember that each volume has three parts: header, bitmap, and blocks. If you look at the sifs-viewer, you'll see all of the example volumes have the root directory as the first block. The other block types are file blocks and data blocks, then there is also the unused block.

>If that's the case, do we also have to apply file functions 
like fopen or fread to directories as well if we wanted to do something with them?

I'm not that far along in implementing it, but from my understanding once you have opened the volume, you'll have access to any of the blocks within but you'll have to figure out how to determine their locations in memory based on the root directory which will be the first block in the volume. (If I've got it wrong hopefully someone can correct me on this point).

How do we access the bitmap of a volume after opening the volume? Is it similar to how 
we access structure variables, or can we just declare some array of SIFS_BIT and the 
elements of the array will be the same as the bitmap?

I'm confused with this topic as well and its regarding mkdir.
Once we open an existing volume using fopen(), do we have access to the bitmap,rootdir_block and oneblock? 
Because as I understand we have to somehow go through the bitmap to find an unused block and we have to add a directory block in there, but i don't know how that's possible with just fread() and such.

I understand that we use the typedef keyword to define our new datatype in terms of an

typedef struct {

but that doesnt make any sense ?  its a structure called struct but the type isnt 
structure its type def ? 

also TEAM; is where the structure is stored ? what does TEAM; represent

Hi, hopefully someone can help me to understand this part of the project:

Lines 56 to 59 of mkvolume.c call the function:
size_t fwrite(const void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb,FILE *stream); 

The manual description of this function is:
The function fwrite() writes nmemb items of data, each size bytes long, to the stream pointed to by stream, obtaining them from the location given by ptr.

Given this information, am I correct in understanding that when a volume is created, the header, bitmap and root directory block are just in a general sense written "to the volume" at locations determined by the OS? 

Consequently the sifs-viewer is a representation of the bitmap, not how the contents of a volume are actually structured in the memory. Thus, the requirements for the "first fit, contiguous data-block allocation scheme" for the data blocks is just a concept that we enforce via the bitmap rather than actually controlling where anything is written?

Thanks in advance for your help.

Hi. Specifying a type definition is just a way of simplifying your code.

In the example you gave from Lecture 17, we have TEAM being defined as a type of struct.
If we createtwo new teams we could just do this:

typedef struct {
    char    teamname[MAX_TEAMNAME_LEN+1];
    ....
    int     played;
    ....
} TEAM;
TEAM team1;
TEAM team2;

Instead of this:

struct {
    char    teamname[MAX_TEAMNAME_LEN+1];     
    ....
    int     played;
    ....
} team1;

struct {
    char    teamname[MAX_TEAMNAME_LEN+1];     
    ....
    int     played;
    ....
} team2;

volume name is just a file whit any specific format for your question SIFS_dirinfo() firstly we need to 
check if volume exists or not because there is no meaning of accessing the directory whose volume 
doesn't exists because every time when we add or remove file or directory we have to fwrite(.....) 
changes in that volume file as well because it has every thing related to the library like 
bit_map[MAX_ENTRIES] so for ex when you will add a file or directory firstly you need to check if volume 
exists or not if so than mark the current block as file or directory and rest is in project description.

Answer is here:  https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help2002?p=np&a=735

The mkvolume.c code creates (writes) a new volume, and your question asks about the reverse - 
reading from (an existing) volume.  Have a look at its code.

Like two previous questions, the answer is here:  https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help2002?p=np&a=735

Just as we've used fgets(), previously, to read successive lines of a text file,
we're here using fread() to read successive 'chunks' of data from our volume.

Hi Chris,

Sorry if its a dumb question to ask. But I couldn't figure out how the sifs_mkvolume.c 
has never used any function from the mkvolume.c in the library and still be able to 
create a new volume. It does check the integrity of the input parameters however that 
seems to have nothing to do with creating a new volume.

A file is , well, a file - like a single text document
A directory is more often called a folder
e.g. a folder with several text documents (and perhaps another folder

The mkvolume function makes files of no defined file type
(i.e. they have no file extension - unlike the files: dog.txt, cat.docx, arch.zip ...)
We call these file volumes

 From a (simple) user perspective, 
a ZIP and the aforementioned volume are a single file that hold multiple folders or files in a special way. 
They cannot be accessed like regular folders, although they hold items like folders. 
So they possess similarities.

The main difference between them is that ZIP files compress data (literally make each file smaller), 
while our volumes simply store all files, 
but ensure that no duplicates are made within the volume.
e.g. If you stored two 1GB videos in ZIP file, it might become 1.6GB (after compressing each to 800MB)
But if you stored two 1GB videos in our volume, it would be 1GB (and a bit more for metadata).

A loop control variable doesn't have to be used within a loop, it can (as here) just control the number of times the loop is executed.
In this case, the loop controls how many times that fwrite() is used to write success blocks to the volume.

(a bit difficult to understand what you're asking).

Whenever a file is opened for reading or writing, say with fopen(), within standard I/O library and the OS remembers and tracks where the reading or writing is up to.
Thus, if you open a file and call fwrite(), fwrite(), fwrite() ..... then the information is written to physically successive locations in the file.
Similarly, if reading from a file, you 'get' (read in) successive items from the file.

The above describe the process of sequential I/O, performed in 99+% of all computing.
If you wish to 'break away' from sequential I/O, starting reading or writing somewhere else in the file, you first need to seek to that location.
The project webpage anticipates that you'll need to use fseek() for the project - I suggest you read its manual entry.

Consider this example:

if( something ) {
    i = 1;
}

printf("i = %i\n", i);
}}}

Depending on the value of 'something', the value of i to be printed may be undefined.

It sounds like you're trying to modify (add a file to) a volume without understanding the format of 
a volume - add stuff incorrectly, and you'll 'break' the volume, and may not be able to read or 
recover files from it  (think of it as a form of disk corruption).

Are you using the volume viewer:  https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/sifs-viewer  ?

You may use it to view the structure of some sample volume, download them, and also upload your own 
volumes to see if your changes appear correct.

Your phrase "comes up with" doesn't help us understand how you're obtaining that 
information.

Our volumes are not text files, so you certainly shouldn't try viewing or editing them with 
a text editor.

When you're creating a new directory (or anything for that matter) I don't think it's necessary to set a modification time. I'm assuming (and don't quote me on this) that the OS does this for you. When you need information about a file you'll need to make use of some library functions.

Please see the man page for stat().

Anyone know how we determine pathname or how we find pathname? Is it something to do with where a directory / file is located?

HI Chris
if I want to get the information from a existed volume, how can I get it? like if I 
want to get the blocksize from the header to use in the mkdir function.I try fseek() 
and fread() but don't know how to do, seems the header in the volume contains some 
unreadable codes . Or can i edit the mkvolume function to store the size as a global 
variable?
Thanks

Creating a new directory, adding or removing something to a directory, or creating a new file, requires that you set the
modification time in the directory block or the fileblock.

Adding a duplicate file does not require that the modification time in the file block be updated.

Your computer's OS knows nothing about the format of our SIFS volumes;  it will not automatically set or update any fields in the volume.

stat() only finds information about your OS's files and directories;  it will not find any information about SIFS volumes.

To read the information from an existing volume, you mostly just need to do the 'reverse' of 
what the mkvolume() function does.  Nothing in the volume is 'unreadable', you just have to be 
reading from the correct part of the volume, and then interpreting its contents correctly.

For example:

{{{
FILE *fp = openvolume( volumename );  // you'll need to write this function

if(fp != NULL) {
    SIFS_VOLUME_HEADER  header;

    fread(&header, sizeof header, 1, fp);
    printf("blocksize=%i,  nblocks=%i\n", (int)header.blocksize, (int)header.nblocks);

    fclose(fp);
}
}}}

You possibly could, but I'd advise against it.
You should read the information back in the same way that it's written, not trying to read subfields of a 
structure.

___
You'll not see it in this case but compilers sometimes pad out structures to ensure that members begin on 
certain byte boundaries/offsets within the structure.  For example, a structure defined as

{{{
  struct {
    char    ch;
    int32_t i;
  };
}}}

will likely be 8 bytes in size, not 5, because 3 extra byes will be added to 'pad' the structure so that the 
integer begins on a 4-byte boundary.  Even worse, if asked to optimize the program for size, the compiler may 
choose to reorder the physical layout of the structure  (though this practice has now been deprecated in newer 
standards).  Attempting to first read just a char, then just an integer will then be unsuccessful.

Hey Chris could you tell me that why I'm getting same digest for two different files even

I have to do this manually and then pass it to MD_file(filename)
char *f = MD5_file("s.txt");
char *s = MD5_file("te.txt");
it returns

No, it does not apply to arrays. Arrays don't require any padding, as all elements of any array are the same datatype.

Okay, so one more further clarification. in SIFS_mkdir it only takes two params, volumename 
and dirname. Is it expected that to create a lower level directory that it would be called 
with something like "volume1 directoryUnderRoot/deeperDirectory" where the directory to be 
made would be called "deeperDirectory" which is a sub-directory of "directoryUnderRoot"?

Cheers

Thanks;
I should have added that you'll (soon) appreciate the need for a generic 'internal' library 
function to take a pathanme, break it into its components, and ensure that you can walk 
down the path from the root directory.
You'll then be able to use such a function when making and removing directories and files.

There's no such concept as a block being 'empty', just one that is unused and usually ignored.
With a security mindset, you may like to clear the unwanted directory using memset().

You'll also need to remove the directory's information from its parent directory, set its bitmap 
entry to UNUSED, and write any changed information back to the volume.

Answered (somewhere) elsewhere.
We have no concept of a relative pathnames, so if it begins with '/', you remove all leading 
slashes to achieve the same (toplevel) starting point.

Hi, 
I'm having trouble trying to assign information to 
the entrynames (char***) variable in the SIFS_dirinfo() function, 
as I encounter a segmentation error. 

Here are the relevant parts of my code:
{{{
...
entrynames = malloc(24 * sizeof(char) * 32);
...
...
for (int e = 0; e < *nentries; e++) {
...
entrynames[e] = malloc(sizeof(char) * 32);
strcpy(*entrynames[e], "test string");  
}
...
}}}

Here is the error I get, using the -fsanitize=address switch:
AddressSanitizer:DEADLYSIGNAL
=================================================================
==1672==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address 
0x000000000000 (pc 0x7f09abca6675 bp 0x7ffffe636a70 sp 0x7ffffe6367c0 T0)

==1672==Hint: address points to the zero page.
    #0 0x7f09abca6674 in SIFS_dirinfo (/mnt/c/....


I also tried, within the entries loop:
{{{
entrynames[e] = malloc(sizeof(char) * 24);                
entrynames[e][i] = malloc(sizeof(char) * 32);
strcpy(entrynames[e][i], "test string");
}}}

This removed the SEGV error above. 
But then I was unsure of how to access the data back in the testing program, 
and received a very similar SEGV error again using this method:
{{{
printf("\n  e: %s", entrynames[0]);
}}}

Any help would be greatly appreciated

hey Chris while removing files with rmfile() I have to update entries as well so for the 
file in the root directory 
  entries[ 0] = { blockID=1, fileindex=0 };
  entries[ 1] = { blockID=5, fileindex=0 };
  entries[ 2] = { blockID=1, fileindex=1 };
  entries[ 3] = { };
  entries[ 4] = { };
  entries[ 5] = { };
  entries[ 6] = { };
  entries[ 7] = { };

so for example I have deleted file at entries[2] then what entries[2] will be after 
deleting I can't put entries.block_id = 0 and entries.file_index = 0

this is not a 3d array it is reference to char** entry names
which I mean 
char **ent_names
char ***entry_names = &ent_names

Thanks for that different perspective!
Helped realise that my code needs to be like this:
{{{
...
*entrynames = malloc(24 * sizeof(char) * 50) ;
...
...
for (int e = 0; e < *nentries; e++) {
...
*entrynames[e] = malloc(sizeof(char) * 40);
strcpy(*entrynames[e], "test string");  
}
...
}}}

This is working better than before :)  
but in my testing program, I can only access position 0 
Position 1 or further result in the SEGV READ memory access error I posted
{{{
// I can only do this in the testing program:
 printf("\n   entries[%-2i] = {%s}", e, entrynames[0]   );
}}}

Hi, I am struggling to get my head around this concept. If we write some functions in a 
file that may be used in our other files in the library file, how do we update the headers, 
makefile and anything else that needs to be updated? I currently just have 
helperfunctions.c sitting in the library file... what else must I do?

Sorry, I can barely find a question in your post.
SIFS_dirinfo() returns information about a named directory that must already exist in a volume.

It needs to pass back its results through its parameters, providing the names of all entries, how 
many entries were found, and the modification tiome of the whole directory.

Start simply by first having it only find and pass back how many entries were found, and the 
modification time - solve the simpler challenge before moving to the more difficult/complete one.

If deleting entry #2, you only then need to modify the number of entries.
If removing either of the others, you'll also need to 'squash up' the remaining values.

Write an additional helperfunctions.h header file containing prototypes (declarations) of all your new 
functions, and then #include "helperfunctions.h" in all core files needing them.

Does anyone know the meaning of the cryptic Address Sanitizer message?
(that I posted earlier)
Also, 
Does anyone have any ideas about why only the first position can be accessed?
(of the entrynames array in the testing program)

Firstly, get rid of those numbers in your code - the header files define constants for that 
purpose.

Secondly, you're not allocating memory for a rectangular array; you're incorrectly 
allocating a 1-D vector of memory.
You need to allocate a vector of pointers, and each pointer will point to a string.

Then, use strdup(), not what you have there.

Finally, your use of *nentries is incorrect;
nentries is a pointer so that the function can inform its caller of how many elements (in 
the directory) were found in the required directory and allocated.

Not sure why your original code caused a segfault (accessing a NULL pointer, pointing to 
the zeroth page), but correct the above errors and see if it improves.

Hi all
i have a question about how to represent a file or directory is under one directory in

bitmap have 2 directory. But the hierarchy did not appeal a sub directory under a root 
directory.

Difficult to understand your question, or 'predict' what the reasons might be, but are you 
entering the new directory's information into the root directory?

Yes.my program just created a new directory but not the sub directory under the root directory. i
know it is not simply just adding a directory in the volume but don't know how to link the two 
directories by coding.

Are you adding the new directory's name into one of the entry fields of the root directory, incrementing the 
count of entries, and writing that all back to the volume?

Good luck,

Different person here.
So do we have to open the root directory that gets created initially and add the 
new directory data into the root directory?

If so, do we have to add a new SIFS_DIRBLOCK instance inside the already existing 
rootdir_block?

Thanks

You don't specifically open the root directory; you open the whole volume, once, and then can 
read and (over)write any of its contents - the bitmap and all of the blocks holding 
directories, files, and file-contents.

 
> If so, do we have to add a new SIFS_DIRBLOCK instance inside the already existing

No, you set an element of entries[] in a directory to include the blockID of the new 
subdirectory.

so the modification time of directory will be the time of its last entry because that will be the only one

time when a file or directory is added or removed, otherwise what it would be I have done the no.of entries 
moving to modification time

Something screwy.
If you compile my short program, above, with:

   mycc -Ilibrary -o t t.c library/md5.c -lm

does it compile, and what's its output?

Hello People,

I'm attempting to write that portion of the code that will create a new directory 
inside an already existing directory - I am going to do this by way of the mkdir 
function. I can successfully create a new directory inside a new volume, but I am 
unsure as to how I might create nested directories.

My cause for uncertainty lies in the fact that the parameters for mkdir consist of 
*volumename and *dirname only - these being the name of the volume in which to deposit 
the new directory of name: *dirname, respectively. As it stands, mkdir cannot place a 
directory within a directory. 

Will I have to modify the parameters of mkdir in order to allow for the creation and 
placement of nested directories?

Thanks for your time,

Fraser

Now how do we use entrynames for getting the name of a file block? Still confusing as 
to how we use triple pointers (maybe explain a bit why malloc is used?).

So we have to write over some things in the volume if we wanted to remove a directory or file 
block. Do we write some empty(?) directory or file block when it's empty into the volume? 
Also do we also have to consider deleting directories and files (like what we see from the 
terminal, because I don't think updating the volume to remove directory or file blocks is 
going to actually remove them)?

Ahhh, now I see the problem, and the reason for your confusion.
Well spotted!

When released, the project webpage gave the prototypes of the SIFS_mkdir() and SIFS_rmdir() 
functions with a second parameter named 'dirname'.

In fact, for both functions, the second parameter should have been named 'pathname', to indicate 
that an arbitrary pathname, not just a directory name, should be supported by the functions  (just 
like all of the other functions).

The Clarifications page has been updated.

"Undefined architecture" usually suggests that you compiled some code on platform-A, and then tried to use/link it on platform-B.  
Perhaps you've copied files from Linux to macOS (different architectures) and tried to use them?

Running 'make clean' and restarting should fix things.

All unrelated to the topic's title, now.

I'm sorry, i reported that very badly. I am only using macbook OS. My error is actually Undefined symbols for architecture, referring to my

At this level you should be able to get that sample code to compile, then run it, and then let

hey Chris in the read_file() we are given void** data so how would I store data in it I 
know I can cast it (char**)data and also if had to return it then I can use another
pointer like
(char**) another = (char**)data
....
......
and then return that another pointer but here I have to store data in this void**data. 
it says Incompatible pointer types initializing 'char **' with an expression of type 'void 
**'

The entrynames parameter is a medium for data, not a source of it
We need to malloc because declaring a pointer does not "create" a pointer
We use malloc for its return value - a pointer of a certain size
It allows us to store a valid pointer into our pointer declaration

Thankyou Chris for your help
And thankyou to the kind person who posted this snippet:
{{{
char **entries = malloc(N*size_of(char*))
for(i =0 ,.......)
    entries[i] = malloc(N*size_of(char))

entries[i] = "........"
entries[i] = "........"
entries[i] = "........"
entries[i] = "........"
entries[i] = "........"

char ***entry = &entries
}}}

This way makes a lot of sense to me, 
as now the problem is in terms of 2D array allocation, which I understand.

However, when I implemented it, it did not work. 
SIFS_dirinfo ran without issues - 
but the testing program could not access the entrynames data.
The SEGV memory issue from before re-surfaced. 

So I checked the value of the entryname pointers (local variable in the testing program) 
before and after the library call (SIFS_dirinfo). There was no change. 
The pointers remained at a value of "nil" - 
which seems consistent with Chris's suggestion that it was there was a READ of a NULL pointer.

This indicated to me that the last line of the snippet above was not correct
The assignment was not occurring properly 
So I approached it from another perspective:
{{{
*entrynames = entries;
}}}
Lo and behold, everything is now working normally - my problem is solved
My life is complete

Hi, I have been attempting to start the project with mkdir for some time and have just been continually getting bogged down time after time despite repeatedly going over the project code, labs, lectures, forum posts and talking with my project partner.
Judging from other posts a few people seem to have started with dirinfo.
So, to the students who have been able to progress, where do you think is the best place to start?

I've tried to get the name of a sub directory from a given *pathname (this was after I 
opened the volume). I declared a new char pointer, then I used a while loop so that 
the char pointer would be the same as the sub directory up to a forward slash or null-
byte (e.g. *directory = *pathname). It's hard for me to explain, but I think it's like 
the exercises of lab 5. When I try to run this function, for some reason this while 
loop keeps going until a segmentation  fail occurs. Any idea why this happens?

I believe dirinfo is the best place to start because:
- It simply involves reading information, which is simpler than writing. 
- The testing program is already done for it.
- This thread (https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help2002?p=np&a=827&all=y11) 
has a lot of information about writing it.

Thank you for your replies.
I had started on mkdir prior to sifs-viewer being released,
but now it seems dirinfo is a better start with that tool available.
I'm going to keep at trying to make mkdir work for today.

Anyway, can I ask about using fseek to reach a specific block position;
would this involve using SEEK_SET with an offset of...

sizeof header + sizeof bitmap + (blocksize * blockposition)

Or is there a better way of using fseek to get there?

Hey guys,

With the mkdir file, I'm assuming that pathname will be something along the lines of 
"./dir1/dir2" (if dir2 is what you aim to create), where "." is the volume itself, 
dir1 is a directory withing the vol, and dir2 is within dir1. If I run mkdir with 
this as the pathname, should it also create dir1 (in the case that dir1 doesn't 
exist) as well as create an empty dir2? Or should it just give an error saying that 
the path doesn't exist?

Thanks!

I'm afraid I can't diagnose it from your description.
99.99% speculation - is your bit of code, above, meant to be a test for equality, or an 
assignment?

Please don't add one, as it'll make your library and header file different to all others (for testing).
It's a good point; maybe just set it to SIFS_ENOVOL.
There's certainly other error values that could be added, too, such as one for failed I/O.

It could be passed as update_dirnames[SIFS_MAX_ENTRIES][SIFS_MAX_NAME_LENGTH],
which is exactly the datatype it is.

You cannot 'walk up' the volume's directory hierarchy (as directories don't have ".." entries), 
but you can 'walk down' from the root directory.

It's just the root-directory of the volume (if searching for something we always need to start from this (top

The use of "." in a pathname doesn't really make sense, as directories don't have "." (or "..") 
entries - mentioned a few times already if you can find them.

The pathnames /a/b/c
and            a/b/c

refer to the same item, either directory or file, so you can/should skip all leading '/' 
characters at the beginning of any path.

No, the SIFS_mkdir() function should not recursively make all necessary directories; it should 
only make the single, last name.

Yes, once a volume is opened you'll always need the header and bitmap for "everything"), and 
you'll start searches from the root-directory.  Anything changed (never the header) needs to 
be written back to the volume, then the volume closed.

Most things appear, and are, straight forward after you've thought about them a bit :-)

You've not defined what you mean by "destroyed",
but opening a file for write access, with "w", will not enable you to *read* from it.

So i managed to create a sample program for mkdir. It works when I put in three 
arguments. But when I put in 2 arguments, it just gives the usage error. It was 
probably because of the getenv() function. So what does getenv() do?

Another question, do all pathnames have to start with / ?

Check which number of arguments leads to the usage() call .. Remember to count the name 
of the program as an argument 

getenv() = get environment variable - if you don't want to keep typing the same thing, 
you can retrieve strings from your environment variables

They can, but they don't have to. So many people are asking about paths that I believe 
it should be added to the clarifications page.

Hi Chris,

When calling fread(), does the following two lines do the same thing?

...
int array[size];

1). fread(&array, sizeof array, 1, stream);
2). fread(&array, sizeof int, size, stream);
...

If they are the same, what is the preferred or 'standard' way to call fread()?

Thanks in Advance.

Yes I tried, fileindex is unused or it is an integer. Don’t know how to test for hat... doesn’t it 
get set to zero with memeset... which could be a valid file index even if it’s a dirblock? Thanks

Thank you, but I'm still confused how to do that. A way I figured out is to use part of pathname(the part 
before the last /). But I don't know how to do that to a pointer instead of char array?

Hello again,

So I am attempting to create that part of mkdir.c that will traverse the directory tree down to the specified name 
of the directory that I wish to create. I am not sure how to call the "pathname" of the directory that I wish to 
create at the cmd line. 

If I wanted to make a directory in a volume, would I do something like the following:

./sifs_mkvolume vol_1 X Y
./sifs_mkdir vol_1 /a/b/c/d.../n

Where "n" ix the name of the directory that I want to create.

I am not sure how to implement this in my mkdir.c, specifically; how should we expect to treat the path to the 
directory that we wish to create? Do we specify a path like this: /a/b/c/.../n or like this: a/b/c/../n? Does it 
matter?

Thanks again,

Fraser

The preferred way is as described in the online manual:

    fread(address, sizeof_each_item, number_of_items, fp);

Though be careful with you understanding of how sizeof() is working. Consider:

{{{
#include <stdio.h>

void doit(int *a)
{
    printf("B. s=%i\n", (int)sizeof(a));
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int array[10];

    printf("A. s=%i\n", (int)sizeof(array));
    doit(array);

    return 0;
}
}}}

It's always an integer, but may not be used in some cases.
If the indicate blockID indicates that the entry is a directory, then the fileindex, whatever its value, is not 
(being) used.

We've had a number of labsheet exercises to learn about the equivalence of pointers to character (strings), and arrays 
of characters.  You may need to revise those exercises.

Hello all,

So, I have managed to make a directory - called: 'another_dir' - *inside* a volume of 
mine, however...
when I run these two lines in the cmd line:

./sifs_mkdir my_test_volume another_dir
vim my_test_volume

I get the following:

'another_dir' appears to be 'outside' the bulk of the bitmap, and yet it is still 
inside my_test_volume... somewhere. I have uploaded all this to the viewer and I cannot 
find 'another_dir' there either. 

Does anybody know where 'another_dir' has been put?

We know that "/a/b/c" and "a/b/c" are equivalent, because all pathname searching begins at the root directory.
So to start 'processing' a pathname, first skip over any (possibly multiple) leading '/' characters.

Then, foreach component you find, a then b then c, determine if it exists and if it's a directory.
All path components, other than the last, must be existing directories.
If the last component is a filename, then we also have a problem.

You can try all of the (few) possible cases using your actual operating system and the true 'mkdir' command.

Pathname *components* (sub-directories or filenames) have a length limit (given as a constant in a 
provided header file), but there's no real length to the number of components and, hence, the total 
length.

But it won't be tested with anything 'excessive' - say at most 4 directories deep.

No, because fopen() opens a file on your operating system's real/local file-system, and has no 
understanding of our volume format.

One small detail; what do you mean when you say: "If the last component is a filename, then we also have a problem.

Your volume is not a text file, so you cannot treat it as one and open/view it as a text editor.

Upload it to the sifs-viewer application and see if it can be understood.

Right...

When I open it in the viewer there does not appear to be anything inside the root directory. 
Is it "guaranteed" that all the directories that we create inside our volume, will be created inside 
the root directory of our volume? is it possible for a directory to be "outside" the root directory?

Thanks,

I have finally boiled down my issue in mkdir to the issue in this program:
{{{
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void printer(char *bitmap)
{
	printf("%i\n", (int)sizeof bitmap);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	char bitmap[50];

	for(int i = 0; i < strlen(bitmap); ++i) {
		bitmap[i] = 'u';
	}

        printf("%i\n", (int)sizeof bitmap); //A
	printer(bitmap);                    //B

	return 0;
}
}}}
This prints '50' correctly at A but then prints '8' at B, and I can't figure out why...? 
The sizeof the string is changing when passed to a function.

No guarantees - there's no 'magic' ensuring that you don't make a mistake.

We can say that all directories and all files need to be "in or below" the root-directory - that is, everything 
must be linked together and all directories and files must be able to be found by searching from the root-
directory.

I'm sure you mean SIFS_defrag() - else it'd be too easy!

Yes, you do need to 'squeeze up' the bitmap, as you have above, and also 'squeeze up' the files' 
data-blocks, too.

Correct; the bitmap[] is not a C string, it's an array of known length.

You must have once defined bitmap[],  very likely in terms of header.nblocks,
so you do already know its size.

You need to spend time reading the many related questions on this forum.

(and the header does not contain any modtime).

Yes, I have changed my functions not to except an array of SIFS_BITS which was being used to fseek over 
the bitmap, instead they accept nblocks as a parameter which can be added in the offset of fseek just 
the same as sizeof bitmap.

I've been testing some functions with printf() after using pointers. I saw in the 
mkvolume function that the name of the root directory is a null byte. 

I tried to make a char pointer equal to the null byte. But when I printed out the root 
name and pointer, it first gives nothing (root directory has no name), but the string 
of the pointer prints "(null)". I'm don't want it to be null, but the same as the root 
directory. Why does this happen, and is there a way to go about this?

Here's how I do it - for a string called 'name':
{{{

}}}
I think this saves an empty string instead of a NULL string

It's unclear what you mean by "how to get information inside."
If you're wanting to print the elements, then you should be able to access ptr[0], ptr[1], ....

You'll also need to maintain/rememebr how many elements the array has, either with an extra integer, or 
by adding a NULL pointer as an extra element at the end of the array.

Your phrase "but it doesn't work well" doesn't help us understand the problem.
What do you mean?

The name of the root-directory is not a null-byte, it is an empty-string.
As well as knowing that the root-directory is always at blockID = 0,
you can test for it with:

    if(strcmp(dirblock.name, "") == 0) {
        ....
    }

There's nothing special about the root-volume, other than it always being at blockID=0 and have the empty string as its 
name.
When making changes to the volume (the bitmap and the directory blocks) are you writing everything back to the volume 
before closing it?

Yes, I'm trying to write into the volume before closing it. Would we also have to copy the memory of the directory into a 
character array before writing that array into the volume (like what happens in mkvolume)? That's the only thing that I can 
think of right now.

Sorry for the unclear explanation. Yes, I meant to print them out. When I tried to print the elements inside the 
'split' function, I got what I expected:

toReturn[0] = 1st.README
toReturn[1] = a
toReturn[2] = b
toReturn[3] = sdaada
toReturn[4] = sa
toReturn[5] = (null)

and I returned toReturn at the end. But when I try to print them out again in another function(say main), here's 
what I wrote:
char *p = "////a/b/sdaada/sa/1st.README";
char** test = split_pathname(p);
for(int i=0;i<5;i++){
    printf("test[%i] = %s\n",i,test[i]);
}

and I get:
test[0] = ?
test[1] = 
test[2] = 
test[3] = 
test[4] = 
test[5] = (null)
don't know why I got these.

If you check the manual carefully, reading what the different modes do, you'll find the one you need.

Hi,

Sorry if these are stupid questions, just wanting to clarify things.

Is the volumename the volume in which the directory we want exists?


Can someone give me an example of what a pathname would look like? In the comment it says 
"the required directory name on the volume" so it is just the name of the directory we are 
wanting the information for? or is the pathname something else?



Hope that makes sense,

Thanks

Hello again,

I have made several attempts at creating a directory in a volume and they all end up "creating" my directory outside of the main 
sequence of the bitmap:

./sifs_mkvolume vol_a 1024 20
./sifs_mkdir vol_a /dir_a

will give:

              duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu                                -k]                                                                                                                                                                                                            
ddir_a             l]        

so dir_a is still "outside" the main bitmap.
I know this is essentially my first question again, but I am really quite stuck.
Any suggestions?

Thanks

I've read the manual. We have fopen to mode r+, but now I'm starting to feel that w+ is the one that we 
need to put in (but when I change it to w+, our function would only give a segmentation error after reading 
the file's contents). I'm worried we may have used fopen wrong. Is it w+?

Hello,

The volume is the file in which the directories that we will make, write to and delete will be stored. So - 
as far as I am aware - if there is a directory that you want to read, it will be "inside" the volume. 

As for your question on pathnames... I have my own doubts on the matter. Chris has said that "all leading 
/'s will be ignored" and thus, that we could specify the path: a/b/c in any one of the following ways 
a////b/c, a/b/////c, a////b////c etc...  I have found that my program will not do anything if I do not 
include a '/' in front of the file that I wish to access, so if I wanted to make a dir: "dir_2" in my 
volume: "vol_2", I would do this:

./sifs_mkdir vol_2 /dir_2

I thought about that too. However, when there are multiple characters in a directory name, simply 'skipping' through the

Hi,

When checking whether the entering directory exists or not, do we have to locate and 
read from all the directory blocks according to the bitmap? Or is it allowed that we 
store the directory names into a global array whenever we create a new one? 
In other words, can we add stuff to the header files so that some variables can be 
accessed without the need to fseek() and fread() every single time?

I think SIFS_EINVAL is the more appropriate option.

In trying to update the rootdir_block in mkdir, I'm using the same method that (apparently) works for updating the header and bitmap. Basically, this involves:

1) seek to the correct position
2) create a local variable of the same type as the target
3) read the file to the local variable
4) update the local variable
5) seek back to the correct position
6) write the local variable to the file

However, for some reason it won't compile for rootdir_block. 
The message I get is error: incompatible type for argument 1 of 'fread'

Is this happening because it is a struct? Does anyone have any hints for how
to work this problem out?

My arguments for fread during this process are fread(&dirblock, sizeof dirblock, 1, vol). Maybe that helps. My SIFS_mkdir function seems to work well.

In sifs_internal.h there is a comment that says do not change anything in this file. 
You only need to check if there is a directory with the same name in the same directory that you

Thanks for your response Jasper, it worked!
You are a gentlemen and a scholar.

Is the address of the pointer required because it is pointing to a struct?
I can't seem to find the explanation for this, but I'm wondering if this only applies to structs.

can someone help me with the fseek. So everytime Ive created a local variable and fread the data in I do e.g fseek(vol,sizeof bitmap,SEEK_SET). And 
then after ive made the required changes i do fseek again but with SEEK_CUR and fwrite it back into vol. Am i on right path?

No, it's not enough.
My comment was in response to how to treat multiple consecutive slashes in a pathname.
You'll need to handle the actual components, between the slashes, differently.

Perhaps your new variable (local to the for loop's body) is not being initialised by reading it from the volume.
It won't change all by itself!

It's unclear what you mean by "will we be given the root directory in pathname".
A pathname explicitly mentions the root-directory with "/hello",
or implicitly implies it with "hello".

Far easiest to always use SEEK_SET;  then you don't have to remember where you're "up to".

The pieces are the defined structures that the volume holds.

How about the case of calling SIFS_mkdir() with arguments (vol1, /)?

Should this make a directory underneath the root that is also of the name ""? This leads to the 
question, should SIFS_mkdir() allow a directory of name "" to be made anywhere in the tree?

Meaning that pathname "a/b/c" is actually different to "a/b/c/", which is different to "a/b/c//", with 
the first making a directory of name c inside b, the second making a directory of name "" inside c, 
and the third making a directory of name "" inside another named ""...

Of course, from this it follows that "a//b" is different to "a/b", which Chris has explained multiple 
times is not the case. So this feature of adding directories with empty strings must not be supported. 
But I feel like it's possible, and maybe should be...

It's unclear if you're asking a question, overthinking it, or just dumping a stream of consciousness.

By now, all of these points should be well understood, or just common sense:

- the '/' character separates directory components
- pathnames may have successive directory separators, which have the same meaning as if just one was used
- no directory's name includes a directory separator
- all directories, except the root-directory, have a non-empty name
- the name of the root-directory is the empty string
- all pathnames refer to an item relative to the root-directory

We don't normally think of releasing an amount of memory, just releasing the memory pointed to that was 
given to us by the allocation system.  Let the malloc() family of functions manage the location and size 
of the memory it allocates, and just call free() on the original pointer.

Hi,

No matter what I do trying to understand pointers I just don't get why we use them. I 
fell that assigning to variables is so much easier and clearer to understand. 

For example why would we want to hold the address of a variable when we can just do 
the same with assigning a variable to the value of the variable. e.g.

int c = 5;
int *p = &c;

why is this better then the following:

int c = 5
int p = c

Also I am unclear on double pointers. What is the use of pointing to a pointer that 
points to an address of a variable?

One of the main uses is for modifying the contents of a variable when passing between

void pfoo(int *c){

I am currently still working on mkdir, and although I can access the information I want and 
manipulate them, I have found that whenever I run the function, my volume will lose its 
contents. 

So for a volume with a block size of 1024 and 50 blocks, it would initially be around 51kb 
in size, but after running my function, which now only has fopen and fclose in r mode, my 
volume file is now at zero kb and has no content inside. 

May I know if this is normal, and that I have to copy all its information and rewrite it 
back or is something not right with what I am doing.

Thanks.

I've got a questions about the blocks in the volume. I understand that the first block 
is a root directory, however a directory can be longer then just 1 block?

Also, The way I look into directories is that the directories hold files that hold 
data. So when we have a block that is a directory, how exactly is that mapped towards 
the files with in the volume since the files will be blocks themselves on the volume I 
assume.

No. The entries array should only contain subdirectories and files in that directory.

The short answer is no. 

 The long answer is the essence of a recursive directory structure. Each directory in a file system should only store entries that are its direct children in the file tree. This applies to the root directory as for any other directory. Consider the file structure below:

/
----mydir1
----myfile1
----mydir2
--------myfile2
--------mydir3

In this file system the root directory would only store entries for mydir1, myfile1 and mydir2. If I wished to search this tree for the file with the filepath: /mydir2/mydir3/hello_world.c I would first search through the entries for the root directory, /, find mydir2, and then search through its entries to find mydir3, and finally I would search through its entries and find that there is no such file as hello_world.c and (hopefully) throw an error to that effect.

Is it entirely necessary to create separate header file for helper functions? My understanding of the structure of this project is that the sifs-internal.h file would contain the declarations of functions and data structures integral to the function of the library but which end users do not need to understand to use the library. Thus, wouldn't it make more sense to place declarations for hidden functions here?

I'm making a function that returns a double pointer (like a string array). When I 
printed out the elements within the function, it worked. But when I tested it with a 
main function, all the elements seem to be null. Anyone know why this is the case?

Yes but the helper functions header file would also be hidden from the user so there wouldn't be any issues (make sure to place it in the library subdirectory). The benefit of having a separate header file is just neatness/clarity.

Hi,

I've been trying to check if a directory exists.

I've tried with access and S_ISDIR but it's not working. I don't think that it is correctly 
checking the volume but rather the working directory. How can I check the volume instead?

Thanks

Hello,

The number and type of questions you're asking indicate that you're very confused about the project.
You will get a lot of background information about the project from the project webpage, and from 
reading strongly related questions and answers on this forum.
But try to focus on one issue at a time - there's event a topic, started by students, about where to 
start.

Do you have a project partner?  If not, I strongly suggest that you try to get one and work with them.

No, the last part is not true.
All blocks have a fixed size, say 1024 bytes.
Blocks can hold the details of either a directory block, a file block, or 'pure' data.
The first two are, by design, smaller than the common 1024 byte size, the datablocks are *exactly* 
the same size.

Please re-read the project sheet, which (I believe) clearly describes this.
Directories hold entries, which can be either other directories or files...
But the entries inside a directory are *not* the physical copies of, say, another directory, but 
the blockID, in the same volume, of the other (nested) directory.

Try the viewer with a couple of the samples, and click the red blocks (directories) to see what 
they hold.

Have a look at sample Volume-C in the viewer.
Click on the red block (root-directory) and see/follow the values of the enclosed blockIDs and file 
index values.
Sample volume-C is a good example because it includes a duplicate file.

Answer to your question - is no.

Each directory, and each file, resides in only one parent directory,
and not in a grandparent, or great grandparent .... directory.

You can experiment with the standard file-system on your own computer, where the semantics of this are 
identical.

What extra support is required?  Backslash is just a character, with no special meaning 
unless you place an interpretation on it.

But I'd focus on the 'bigger questions', the 7 or 8 primary functions, rather than smaller 
points such as this.

Both access() and S_ISDIR (first requiring stat()) are used when accessing details about files and 
directories on your operating system's files on your hard-disk.

They have nothing to do with our SIFS volumes.

If we were accessing the contents of our operating system's directories, we'd use the system-calls 
opendir() and readdir().

Instead, for our SIFS volume(), we're combining most features of these two functions into our own 
SIFS_dirinfo() function.

You don't have to use malloc() if you don't think you need it.
If not using dynamic memory allocation, in the presence of data of an unknown size, then you must instead be using large, fixed sized arrays to hold 'everything', but that's not a preferred practice.

It's difficult to imagine how you're implementing SIFS_dirinfo() without using dynamic memory allocation.

The simple way to test your new functions in your library is to have a small test program that 
simply calls a library function.

Look at the provided sifs_mkvolume.c program.
After checking its command-line options,  it simply calls the library function SIFS_mkvolume() 
and checks the return result.

The 'process' of writing a test function for your SIFS_mkdir() function is almost identical 
(below).

Using an existing, even a downloaded sample volume, run this program, upload the modified 
volume to the viewer,  and see if it looks like you'd expect.

Yes, your helper functions can do whatever they need to do, and if they need access to known information from the 'core' 
functions, then that information should be passed as parameters.
If you pass an open file-pointer then, yes, your helper functions are accessing, possibly updating, your open volume.

If a file currently exists in a directory, then duplicating that file will certainly result in the new filename being 
referred to by a different fileindex  (the index, position, in the same fileblock).

It may not necessarily be one more than the original - it depends on where it's added to the fileblock - but it will 
be a different value.

You do not really *pass* entrynames *into* SIFS_dirinfo(). 
Instead, SIFS_dirinfo() builds a 'ragged array' of names (string), very similar to the physical 
layout of the common argvalue array,  and then provides that array back to the code that called 
SIFS_dirinfo().

SIFS_dirinfo() builds that array, and provides (returns) it to the calling code.

From: chris.mcdonald@uwa.edu.au
X-smilie: none

X-announcefor: 1w

The need for a 'triple pointer' when calling the SIFS_dirinfo() function is
prompting many questions on our forum, and causing inordinate grief for too
many students.  While this is not a simple concept to understand, it's one
producing more concern this year than in previous years  (add speculation here).  

The linked code reads a number of lines from a text file (its own source code),
allocates memory for a copy of each of these lines, and 'passes back' the copies
of the lines to the calling code.  The memory allocation is very similar to the
solution to the file-reversing question of Labsheet-5;
only the passing of the result to the caller is different.

  http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/projects/pointerpointerpointer.c  

This is not a drop-in solution to what the SIFS_dirinfo() function needs to do.
You will still need to find the names of all directories and files in a named directory,
but this function should now help you to allocate memory for copies of those names,
and to then return the allocated memory to a function testing SIFS_dirinfo().

Hi Chris

I was doing the mkdir and dirinfo files and I was curious about a few things.

1. I understand that each block contains a char "U,D,F,D" depending in the bitmap. 
Assuming we won't be accessing the bitmap via the char values but rather the blockid. 
Can the SIFS_BLOCKID be used with an array of block id's, like the SIFS_BITS?

2. When we are accessing information from the structure of SIFS_DIRBLOCK in the 
dirinfo, is it the right direction to create a pointer to that structure and assign 
the address of that particular directory and then get the info? I'm very new to 
pointers so just wondering if this is in the right direction.

Hey,

   Quick question, I've made a header file called helper.h/.c. 
If this file fopens the volume to do some stuff, is it proper to fclose the volume 
at the end of the helper file? Or is it okay to leave the volume open, and fclose it 
at the end of the file it's used in (dirinfo and mkdir in this case)?

OR... is it possible to just pass the open volume as a parameter to the function 
being called from helper.h, and then not worry about fopen/fclose in the helper 
file?

Thanks!

You may have worded that badly - each bitmap entry holds one of the 4 characters to indicate what 
its corresponding block is being used for.

Yes, that's the only way. A blockID is an index into the bitmap array.

That's one way, but if you read a dirblock's contents into a variable of type SIFS_DIRBLOCK, can 
can simply access

      dirblock.nentries,  etc

which doesn't involve a pointer.

All are possibilities, depending what you need to do.
of course, you can't close a file pointer "at the end of the file", as code to close a file 
needs tone in a function.

Just ensure that if your library (anywhere) opens a volume, that it closes the volume before 
execution leaves the library.

If you set a char array to 0, copy memory of i.e. a directory file, then write it into the volume, are we also 
overwriting the other contents of the volume with the 0's? It seems like every time I try to add a directory, 
the last directories get overwritten (is that even possible?).

Sorry if this is still confusing; I mean we we call 
memset(array, 0, sizeof array), memcpy(array, &directory, sizeof direcotry) then 
fwrite(...) and we're only changing one thing (e.g. entries) of the directory, is it 
likely we could overwrite/reset the memory of that directory? (because of memset?) Or 
is it supposed to just stay the same?

Thanks; I can now read it, but it's unclear what you're trying to do.

What is 'array', an array of what?
Is 'array' actually a datablock,  of size:  char arreay[header.blocksize]  ?
Is 'array' big enough (larger than) the size of a directory?
And what are you writing with fwrite() - guessing it's the array?
But if you're writing an updated directory, why are you now calling fwrite() with a directory?

Thank you for the detailed code, but could you explain more about how should I compile this testing file? 
Because I've tried to compile it by terminal(mycc -o sifs_mkdir sifs_mkdir.c) and by editing Makefile. 
Sadly, neither of them worked. I assume editing Makefile might be a better way, but except adding 
sifs_mkdir to APPLICATIONS, what else should I do? Thank you.

If that code is in a file named sifs_mkdir.c
and is placed in the top-level directory of the provided code,
then the Makefile, there, will compile and link it for you.

If you want to update a block, holding anything, you'll need to first read it from the volume, update some of its 
fields, and then then write it back to the volume.
You must write it back to the same place (offset from beginning of the volume) that you read it from, so use fseek() 
to first move the correct position.

The name is in stored in the dirblock struct on the volume. 
The blockID tells you where where this dirblock is.

not sure what were you saying.
the name in the dirblock is the name of the directory.
and you said the blockID can find the name, but this case can only happen when your objective dir is root 
directory. what if this directory is the directory which not is the root directory?
according to what you said, am I correct to think that each directory has its own volume? (the directory 
is the root directory in another volume)

Hi,

I don't normally reply on here but I thought I could maybe help. I assume you want to access the name of the 
entries in the directory? If so, then you want be trying to access the structure entries[SIFS_MAX_ENTRIES] 
which will link the file or directory that it holds. Foe example, use the SIFS viewer and one of the options 
look at the root directory in Block id 0. You will notice that it hold other block ids of files and 
directories which we can use to get information about them. Basically then, the job is to find what is held in 
those block is and get the information.

Hope that helps

Thanks Chris, sorry for the badly worded question.

Before I continue in case I might be blind, the code given when downloaded the project2 doesn't include 
the blockid array yet? For example, the SIFS_BITS is initialised with bitmap[nblocks] in the mkvolume, 
but we need to create the blockid array or is it in there already that I can't see.

Hi there,

Lots of people have suggested starting with that file, but personally I found it easier to look 
at the "sifs-internal.h" and see all the global variables. There it shows you what attributes a 
directory SIFS_DIRBLOCK will have.

This lecture: http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/lectures/lecture17/singlepage.html
might be some use to you. It explains how to access the information from a structure which is 
essentially what the dirinfo is doing.

Regarding your bitmap question, the bitmap viewer: https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/sifs-
viewer is perfect in explaining how it works. Essentially your job is fill in the blocks with 
either a directory, file or data. Again the "sifs-internal.h" has all the definitions about the 
variables and restriction you need to use.

My advice which may differ from others is to look at the mkvolume and mkdir outside the library 
folder and see how they are implemented.

Hope this helps. No doubt Chris will better this.

If I make the dirs[n] a pointer of array *dirs[n] and then assign it the malloc() on

is this how it works?

Hi All,

I am trying to print the nentries in the root directory (rooter_block.nentries).

However it is returning 1970632053.

I am not sure what is causing this.

Is it simply because in this line you typed '.entries' instead of '.nentries'...

Hi,

So how do you determine whether an entry is a directory or a file? Because I think 
every fileindex from a directory block returns 0 (when I tried to print it) even if 
it's labeled 'unused' in the sifs-viewer.

If you want to write inside the bitmap the offset should simply be sizeof header from SEEK_SET, then 
fwrite(bitmap, sizeof bitmap, 1, fp)

Sure you could do that. But the bitmap won't tell you any information about their 
relationship (eg. subdirectory).

And also, how do I change entries? root_dir.entries[nentries].blockID = n;Then fwrite. 
doesn't work for me.

Check the manual entry for access. It says that F_OK tests for the existence of a file and returns 0 on success.

If you can't remember your password on Ubuntu, you may need to boot in to recovery mode.

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecoveryMode

Then, when you reset your password; run this:

{{{
sudo apt-get install build-essential
}}}

Hope it's useful.

hi there,

when I invoke it like ./a.out volA dfghgd/ghj/hjfhgf
it just prints dfghgd infinitely.
it seems that token can never reach the next string ghj,why?

they would be stored in the same fileblock. The only difference is now, you would be 
able to find the file as TWO ENTRIES of the same BLOCKID, but different FILEINDEX from 
different SUBDIRECTORIES

The provided code *can't* correctly define the bitmap[] array;
it's not known, until you read in an actual volume's header, how many elements bitmap[] requires.

./sifs_dirinfo volD /

SIFS_writefile() needs to be provided with the data and length of that data or the new file to 
be written.  You'd typically allocate memory to store the to-be-saved file entire contents, and 
provide that to SIFS_writefile().

A variable defined and used in one function in a different file won't automatically be

In Lecture 12 it mentions the global.c file that declares the variables etc. for all files. Does

For example, the problem I am having is the bitmap. In the mkvolume.c file it is intitialised and

the mkdir file to check that the bitmap is not full or has space for a directory?

I was curious if for example the structure SIFS_DIRBLOCK should be used as a type for 
an array of directories. I assumed that SIFS_DIRBLOCK is just the type we use and not 
the variable name itself.

For example:

SIFS_DIRBLOCK dirs[n];
dirs[n].name etc.

and not

SIFS_DIRBLOCK.name etc.

Thank you! It worked when I use nblocks. However it's a bit confusing why is that so? 
Because I printed out both of them and they are just different data type with the same 
value?

Does it matter what order the file is read? 
Because the header is written first does that mean it needs to be read first? And is 
that the reason that when I am reading "&dirblock,sizeof...." it prints out a modtime 
of 1970632053?

The bitmap is just a character array, declare a new one in your mkdir function and read it from the volume.

Hi All,

Recently Mac OS Catalina was released, upon updating my computer, I realised that the default shell has been changed from bash to zsh, with 
associated problems. I thought I should post on here to firstly see if anyone else has experienced anything similar, and secondly to share 
my solution to the problems I encountered.

When opening terminal for the first time, the following prompt appears:

    "The default interactive shell is now zsh.
     To update your account to use zsh, please run `chsh -s /bin/zsh`."

This is simple enough. After running the given command (and entering your password), my shell was successfully changed to zsh.

The problem I encountered was when I now went to compile (make) and run my project code. I got the following error:

    "xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), 
     missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun"

After some research online, I found the following solution worked for me:

    run> "xcode-select --install"

# (I am by no means knowledgeable on this, so if anyone knows a better way or more 'correct' way please let me know)

I hope this was maybe useful to some, who found the same issues, and that the new default zsh won't have any other adverse effects 
for the remainder of this CITS2002 unit. 

Regards.

The makefiles are indeed completed for us. But if you make any new test files (e.g. programs to 
test the API) you need to update the makefiles by adding their names to the APPLICATIONS 
variable. If you make any new helper functions files (in the library directory) you'll need to 
add its object file name to the OBJECTS variable (different Makefile to previous one). 

To run a makefile type "make clean" and then "make". Make sure you are running the correct 
makefile (the one outside the library directory).

Maybe you are reading in more bytes than your array is allowed to? Does nblocks match

Because you're likely using bitmap like this:

{{{
#include <stdio.h>

void function(char *bitmap)
{
    printf("in function: %i\n", (int)sizeof(bitmap) );
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    char bitmap[100];

    printf("in main: %i\n", (int)sizeof(bitmap) );
    function(bitmap);
    return 0;
}
}}}

This will not work, as a directory block is not the first thing in a volume.

If you wrote 5 text lines to a text file, closed and reopened the file, and then attempted to 
read them back, would you hope the lines to be in the same, original order?

Can't tell from what you've provided;
fopen() can fail for a number of reasons, all listed via its online manual entry.

Mostly like the file's permissions - not set for read access ??

Why are you not using the provided Makefile from the original set of files?

The mkvolume.c (file) is not intended to be an executable program, should not have a main() 
function, and does not need to be compiled in any manner other than with the provided Makefile.

A SIFS volume is not a text file.  It does not contain lines of human-readable text; it 
cannot be read (in any meaningful way) using fgets(); and cannot be meaningfully printed 
using printf().

Please talk to a lab demonstrator.

No; libsifs.a is produced by the Makefile in the library directory.
The 'upper-level' directory's Makefile then links libsifs.a with any executable

Sorry Chris,

I just thought by accessing the bitmap that is created via the mkvolume.c file that we need to 
read in volume to access the bitmap. I am trying to read in the bitmap if that is the correct 
things it do in mkdir.

If we were given a directory name like /dir1/dir2/dir3, do we have to traverse 
through the pathname starting from root, checking if its valid? e.g. is there an 
entry for dir2 in dir1 and so on. Or is the supplied path assumed to be valid, and 
therefore we can just directly add dir3 to dir2 without checking its parent 
directories.

In dirinfo, we tried to define *entrynames = entries (which is array of entry

Hi,

I am wondering is first if it's the right way and second that I am thinking this 
correctly.

Basically when the volume is created the bitmap has a root directory created and 
stored in position 0. When a make directory is requested in the mkdir.c file, how can 
I access the up to date bitmap? I know that the sifs-internal.h has the declared 
bitmap but I need the up to date one if possible.

thanks.

Files do (of course) have names.
You'll need to use the blockID and fileindex fields to locate the files' names.

You'll need to check a pathname's validity.

Terminology:

sifs-internal.h defines the datatype of each element of any (future) bitmap.

It doesn't even mention 'bitmap' at all, let alone declare or define one.

So when its declared and initialised in the mkvolume, how is it passed to other functions

Pathname is the "full name" of the destination 
Directory name is the name of the directory name where the file will reside

eg. I have a directory called "subdir1" on the root directory, and I have a file called 
"file.txt" inside "subdir1"

the pathname of "file.txt" is "subdir1/file.txt"
the pathname of "subdir1" is "subdir"

Thanks for posting this;  it'll likely help some other Apple users from
getting 'stuck' as our project deadline approaches.

macOS Catalina (v10.15) was released in the US on Sunday night, and
is now being gradually pushed out to Australia.  After a very long
beta-release programme there's been no significant problems reported
with this release, but at this time of semester you won't want to upset
your Apple's environment.

First thing that all Apple owners could do is disable automating updates
(if they haven't already been forced on you).

Go to Apple Menu > System Preferences > Software Update > Advanced
and disable (uncheck) the 3 Install options.

When the semester is over and all your assessments have been submitted,
there'll likely be an update to Catalina, to 10.15.1 or 10.15.2, which
will also iron out a few bugs.

You should also not upgrade your version of Xcode (via Apple's App Store),
else you'll hit some of the challenges, above.

___
Apple has chosen to change user's default shell from bash to zsh.
This was announced and discussed several months ago:

    https://thenextweb.com/dd/2019/06/04/why-does-macos-catalina-use-zsh-instead-of-bash-licensing/

and is based around Apple's dislike of the GPL v3 software license under
which bash is now released.

There's no technical reason to leave bash, or to fear zsh;  I've used
zsh for near 20years (before that ksh), and its differences to bash are
almost impossible to detect (or to need to use):

   https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/361870/what-are-the-practical-differences-between-bash-and-zsh

zsh just takes a little while to setup (maybe Apple converts your bash
scripts for you??) but it's not time you'll want to waste at this time
of semester.

Good luck,

hey chris i'm really struggling on how to process the pathname input in mkdir.
///dir1/dir2/dir3
/dir1///dir2//dir3///
dir1/dir2/dir3///
there can be many variations and i'm trying to write an appropriate loop to process 
them. right now I've gotten something like
if(*pathname == '/')
{
   while(*pathname == '/')
   {
        pathname++;
        i++;
   } 
}

what i'm trying to do with the above code is that whenever a '/' is read it will keep 
going until '/' is not being read. But other than that i'm rather lost. Any hints or 
tips?

So what do you pass to the writefile function? Does the path name not include the name of the file to

Your Project-1 marks are now finally available.  You should be able to
see your mark /40 (contributing 20%) in csmarks, and you should be able
to download your feedback sheet by clicking on its icon.

The average mark of all 203 submitted projects from 306 students was
29.2/40 (after applying late penalties).  Congratulations to the 121
students who received 35 or higher /40, and to the 13 students receiving
40/40 - must have been too easy!

Your mark /40 was composed of up to 20 marks for manual inspection of
your code, by one of three markers, and up to 20 marks for automated
testing against 9 tracefiles, and 2 (free!) marks if your program simply
compiled without errors or warnings.

Of note, the average marks from each of the 3 markers (marking around 70 projects
each) were 15.75/20, 15.97/20, and 15.54/20 and I have no concerns about the slight  
differences. 

For the 5 more difficult tests, your output only needed to be within +/-%5
of the sample solution's output to receive a mark.

I'll provide a shellscript, shortly, so that you can run and test your
own project with these tracefiles.

If your mark appears as Not-Available (as opposed to Not-Submitted)
it may be for a number of reasons:

- you worked with another student who didn't add your details to the
  submission. Please speak with them, and *both* of you send me an email
  to confirm this.

- I've already emailed you, stating that your project could not be
  compiled (and hence be tested) and your mark has yet to be finalised.

- I've already emailed you, stating that I've referred your submission
  to the Faculty's Academic Conduct Advisor.

If your project received very low marks for the automated section, it
was likely because it produced no parseable output, possibly crashing
without any output.  Please let me know if this was unexpected
(ideally after running the testing script, yourself).

Good luck in your 2nd project.

Hi,

I'm trying to write mkdir and I'm under the impression that I have to use fseek and fwrite

How do I access/get the size of the bitmap?

I'm a bit confused how we can access the structures that have been declared in other 
functions (bitmap being declared and defined in mkvolume).

Hi, just wondering do we need to "append" the following blocks after removing a directory

By append, for example we have a bitmap: ddfbuu(where f is not in the second d), after 
removing the second d, should we get dufbuu or dfbuuu?

Thanks.

Firstly, can I strongly encourage you to use punctuation in your posts?
It'll help a lot if readers can see some commas to break up your question.

I don't believe that there's a single way to defragment a volume simply by looking at its bitmap. 
Depending on how large the files are (how many data blocks there contents require), and where they were 
originally placed, the results of defragmentation will be different.

The pathname is a pathname *in the volume*, not on your OS's file-system.
The volume's pathname tells writefile where to add the incoming data, not where to get it from.

A typical test program may be similar to the cp command:

   ./sifs_cp  volumename  localfilename-source  volumepathname-destination

Another post for your collection.  Seriously, why?

mkvolume, as provided, works and does not require changing.
Once a call to mkvolume returns, its local variables are no longer available. 

Why can't your other functions simply have their own variables, as necessary?

nblocks is a field in the volume's header.
Read in the volume's header, access its nblocks field....


(politely, I'm stumped at the number of ways students are having difficulty mentally reversing the 
sequence of operations performed by mkvolume).

You could, possibly, defragment your volume after every removal operation, but it's not required.

Get the basic stuff working first.

I tried searching the forums but couldn't find anyone with similar problems.

When I am searching through the bitmap, each block is a char. So if I do the 
following:

for (int i = 0; i < nblocks; i++){
    if(strcmp(bitmap[i],SIFS_UNUSED) == 0) {
        //DO STUFF
    }
}

If bitmap[i] is a char and SIFS_UNUSED is 'u' how do we use the SIFS_UNUSED to compare 
the char in the bitmap? I keep getting an error saying that SIFS_UNUSED is type int 
trying to pass into parameter const char *.

I'm probably missing something simple here.

Thanks.

Sorry, still a little confused about writefile. Does data refer to the file that is to be written (if so, do we 
also need to see if it exists like the volume)? So nbytes is the length of the file to be written; is that 
provided by the user like pathname or is it calculated within the sample programs?

You can compare chars using the same notations as an ints. (i.e 'a' == 'a', would return true.

I was lost as well but I figured how to read the volume file, will try and explain it so bare with me.

1. Open for reading with: fopen()
2. Move to the position you want to read. Like moving the curser to that postion. Using: fseek()
3. Read the data using: fread()

Google each function if you are unsure how they work.

Try checking all your values to make sure you don't have corrupted data:

Something like this should work:

printf("Value in bitmap at %i is %c. The SIFS_BIT is %c\n", i, bitmap[i], 
SIFS_UNUSED);

Hi Chris,

Can I get some clarity on these questions:

1. If a memory allocation call fails do we need to free all other memory that has 
been allocated before we return control to the function calling our API?

2. If we have implemented a defrag function, should it be called when trying to write 
a file, or do we still return SIFS_ENOSPC. Even if we could defrag the space?

3. Do we need to check for read/write errors?

Thanks Michael

Check the SIFS_FILEBLOCK struct in the sifs-internal.h, you will see that md5 is an 
unsigned char. You have to use a different function then strcpy, as it is not 
expecting a string.

In an ideal world, yes, because we don't want libraries to leak memory if they can avoid it.
But each of the 7 core functions should be relatively short (lines of code), so always exiting at 
their bottom and cleaning up as you leave the library would be that ideal control-flow.

Perhaps a more important issue is the change of the bitmap - if you 'grab' some unused blocks and 
then do not use them, they should return their state to being unused.

*IF* you already have a defrag routine, and you call it, and it works, and you can now add a new 
file, then you haven't run out of space. ??
In either case, have the return value reflect what has occured.

> 3. Do we need to check for read/write errors?

No (answered previously). because addresssing the problem (undoing pending volume changes) is 
well beyond the project.

Hi Chris,

Is it ok to have more than one return statement in a function or should we use a 
local variable to set and return information? I have heard that having multiple 
return statements in a function/main is bad programming practice but the mkvolume 
function uses multiple return statements. Thanks

There's good arguments both for and against multiple returns (insert rambling essay here).

Doesn't matter for this project, but would be a consideration in a unit focussed on robust 
software engineering practices.

Every volume has one header, one bitmap, and then N equal-sized blocks.
If you need to update the bitmap you first need to fseek to the physical location of the bitmap 
to then overwrite it.

You are reading a file from your OS's disk (yes, it must first exist), then giving the file's contents (as data) to a library 
function to write that data, as a series of blocks, into the volume at the specified pathname (which must not already exist).

Hi Chris,

I'm having trouble understanding the effects of the following lines in mkvolume.c:

56     fwrite(&header, sizeof header, 1, vol);
57     fwrite(bitmap,  sizeof bitmap, 1, vol);
58 
59     fwrite(oneblock, sizeof oneblock, 1, vol);  // write rootdir

When I create a volume of blocksize 1024 and 10 total blocks, the output (written 
to the file) is:

duuuuuuuuu???

I understand the d and the 9 u's represent the bitmap and are produced by line 57 
but I don't get why the question marks (produced by line 59) are output to the 
file. 

Also in line 56, it appears the the header struct is being written to the file. 
Since it doesn't appear in the volume file, where is it being written too? And what 
exactly is it writing (the contents of the header struct?)?

I would really appreciate your help.

Posted quite a number of times - the volume is not a text file, so you cannot display or edit 
it that way.

Use the web-based file-viewer.

I'm a little confused how to use fseek().

 From what I have done in the mkdir file, I have fopen the volume and the fread the header. However, I am unsure where to put fseek in all of this. I 
understand what it does but I don't understand whether to use fseek after I have fread the bitmap. e.g.

fopen(volume)
fread(&header)
fread (&bitmap)
fseek(bitmap)
frwite(bitmap)
fclose(fp)

This is a rough sketch of how I am thinking but struggling to implement.

Hi Chris, 

There is a few questions that I have that I will like to make sure I am understanding 
properly. Please could you confirm my following assumptions? 

1. There is three different types of functions and I would like some clarification on the 
difference of each. Lets use mkvolume as an example. The three function options are 
SIFS_mkvolume (from sifs.h), sifs_mkvolume.c and mkvolume.c (within the library). When I 
call a function, I am meant to call the functions within the library? 

2. When I download the volume files I get weird text. for example, the text I get when I 
download VolA is

To add to this, I would assume the fseek() would look like this:

fseek(fp, sizeof header,SEEK_SET);

The reason is the first block or index in the file will be 'd' for the root directory after the headers. But again it doesn't seem to be working for me. I 
think where I am positioning it may be a factor? Any suggestions?

Hi Chris,

What do you mean by "datablocks are *exactly* the same size."? Can the data contained in a file not 
be bigger in size than the datablocks? And if so, I assume we calculate how many blocks we need and 
allocate accordingly.

I have two questions 
1. in regards to rmdir and rmfile; do we have to make the volume data successive? 
for example;  is dddddffuuuu or ddduudddduu ok? 
2. how do we distinguish pathnames with the same name for exmaple: a/a/a

When we upload our own volume. If I have completed the mkdir file but not the mkinfo, 
is it normal to have the directories to be 0 or empty values? I have assigned values 
to the discretionary in mkdir. Just wondering if viewer only outputs it when dirinfo 
is complete.

Thanks.

I am currently trying to read the volume to get its sub-directories. Whilst, the

always gives me this error at the end.

*** stack smashing detected ***: <unknown> terminated
Aborted (core dumped)

I have narrowed it down to my fread() function.

SIFS_DIRBLOCK dirblock
fread(&dirblock,blocksize,1,fp);

I have tried different values for my blocksize, and it works up until blocksize 
becomes ~300.
Im guessing that this is something to do with memory allocation, but even when i 
turn dirblock into a pointer and use malloc(blocksize), it still gives me the same 
error.

Any help on this would be appreciated. thanks

why not use this?
SIFS_DIRBLOCK *blockptr = malloc(header.blocksize + 1);

After I finished the mkdir() function, even though I haven't finished the dirinfo(), I still found the online viewer still displayed the directories I made.

It's a possibility that you may not be updating everything when making a new directory?

Its good practice to use "sizeof" to get the size of what you are writing to.

SIFS_DIRBLOCK dirblock
fread(&dirblock,sizeof dirblock,1,fp);

You may also want to look at:

printf("Size of dirblock is: %li", sizeof dirblock);

You can see the actual size that it is in memory.

If they come from function arguments they must be supplied. As they are required to call the

1. I would say you don't have to, but it would make sense to.
2. I'm unsure what you are asking but if the paths have the same name they are the 
same... if you mean each part ie a a a in a/a/a the same way you would find dir subdir 
file in dir/subdir/file

Hey I am having a certain issues obtaining my volume file using fopen().

Whenever I make a volume using SIFS_mkvolume it creates the file I ask with my 
parameters which makes it 54 kb.

However when I run my custom test SIFS_mkdir which calls the SIFS_MKDIR, in which I 
attempt to open the file using the file and set it to a FILE pointer using 
fopen(volumename, "r").  The file in my directory is reduces back to 0 bytes. I 
believe its making a new one with the same name? Is  there any reason why this is 
happening?   

I have tried for multiple hours to understand the root of this cause looking up 
manuals and experimenting with multiple formats.  It is hard for me to continue with 
the project without getting past this hurdle.

Not sure if it's something simple im doing that I have missed.  I am using WSL for 
context.

Any help would be appreciated.

Hi Chris,

I have a few questions about the errors we need to set when stuff goes wrong.

If writefile was passed a path with a too long filename part (or dirname for mkdir) 
what error would this be?

When writefile is passed file data that is already stored in the volume, but the corresponding fileblock already has SIFS_MAX_ENTRIES number of files, what error do we need?

When we are passed a volumename, and such a file exists on disk and we successfully open it. How can we reliably check that it is actually a volume? I am guessing you could try to read the header data and then compare with the filesize, but this doesn't seem too accurate to me.

One problem me and my partner encountered is how to free memory and close the file after an error,without having a bunch of lines free() before every return 1. One way to help solve this I saw was to have a goto CLEANUP; line for every error where CLEANUP would free the memory and close the file and return 1. Would this be poor style, are there betters ways of going about this?

I had a bit of a look at help beforehand, but sorry if any of these questions have been answered.

Cheers.

I think this is a better thing to look at as it shows the relationship between the 
fileindex in combination to blockID relative to a directory (in this case it is the root

SIFS_mkvolume (from sifs.h) is a DECLARATION (saying that it exist) - useful for doing 
shared/external functions

sifs_mkvolume.c - is an application with a main function that will be turned into an executable 
that calls the library (function in library)

mkvolume.c - the function where all the underlying API functionalities based on making a volume 
will occur (IDEALLY DOES NOT RETURN AN OUTPUT) - also this does not turn into an executable 
that can be run on its own. so u need the application that will run the function from the 
library to test the library

Hi Chris. Can I get some clarification of how the oneblock works.

 From my understanding, the oneblock is a char of size say 1024 which is the blocksize. What gets 
stored in that is through memcpy() of the rootdir_block into the oneblock correct? My issue is when 
in mkdir, how do I actually get the rootdir_block structure information? I have tried to fread() it 
but says that it doesn't exist. I am struggling to understand the oneblock relation with the 
structures. 

In particular, the oneblock doesn't have an index so how do we retrieve the correct information?

Thanks.

Ok, I understand a bit more about writefile, but how exactly do we pass the file's contents to the library function as data? Do we 
have to open (fopen) the file before using writefile in some sample program, then pass the opened file as a paramter?

I don't understand how to get the rootdir_block structure information. I assume, that it is stored in

I think the offset for fseek is wrong. If I was the write data to the block id one, then would fseek(fp, sizeof header + 1, SEEK_SET) for updating dir and fseek(fp, 
sizeof header, SEEK_SET) for updating the bitmap?

When updating block you have to consider the following:
-> header size
-> bitmap size
-> size of the previous blocks

If you're accessing Block id #1 you will take into account sizes of:
-> header
-> bitmap
-> rootdir

so your offset will be something like
offset = sizeof(header) + sizeof(bitmap) + (1)*(blocksize)

Note: 1 is a representation of the number of previous block, that needs to be changed to a variable to write for any blockID

Also do we use fseek first before fread() or after fread()?

Hi chris.

I'm getting this error as well when I update the rootdir_block. I know from using the viewer 
that the added directory is not displaying correctly, however the updated root directory is 
updated perfectly.

Is it possible since abort 6 is a memory allocation problem that using a SIFS_DIRBLOCK 
rootdir_block and a SIFS_DIRBLOCK dir_block could cause this problem when addign both to the 
volume? It looks like a directory is added but the contents are empty. I can't seem to fix it 
although it only arose when I updated the root directory.

From: poster048@student.uwa.edu.au
X-smilie: none

Hello all,

I am currently deciding how to approach the writefile program and I have a few lingering doubts...
For instance, the definition of the SIFS_writefile function in writefile.c is as follows:

int SIFS_writefile(const char *volumename, const char *pathname, void *data, size_t nbytes){
    code body
}

My question is this, is the parameter *pathname* supposed to represent a path to a directory, or a path to a specific 
file?
E.g, will *pathname* deal with paths of the form: 

dir_1/dir_2/dir_3/dir_n/.../file_1.c 
or:  
dir_1/dir_2/dir_3/dir_4/.../dir_n ?

The answer to this question has major ramifications as to how I will approach the writefile program.

Thanks,

Fraser

Having looked into it further strcpy is causing the problem. If I perform strcpy(dir.name,dirname) 
why does this cause abortion 6 and how can I get around this.

Strcpy wasn't the problem. Completely lost. All I did was:

fseek(fp, sizeof header + sizeof bitmap, SEEK_SET);
fread(&rootdir_block. header.blocksize,1,fp);

For loop() to get the entries and update them
memset() oneblock to 0
memcpy() rootdir_block to oneblock

fseek() to position of root directory
fwrite() new root directory
fclsoe()

But this annoying Abort 6 keeps appearing.

It may be because you haven't properly stored the blocks/structures correctly, and the sifs_viewer can't read it and causes a potential seg error.

I assign the value of nentries and modtime as such:

*nentries = dirblock.nentries;
*modtime = dirblock.modtime;

Until the end of the process *nentries and *modtime hold the correct information, but 
upon the process ending, the data is lost in sifs_dirinfo.

I've tried malloc() and 'deep' copying, in combination as well.

The weird thing is I only lose modtime on 2 paths (root, sub-dir) and nentries on 3 
paths (root, sub-dir, sub-sub-dir). It works fine when I have a single path (ie the 
root).

Looking forward to a simple reply that makes me look foolish :P

Any tips on how to read in the header from the volume into the struct?


Just also want to confirm, is the header the first thing in the volume?

Another thing to consider, you should use fseek to the beginning of the file again when you want to write things back in. 

So if you want to write to blockID1 you have to take into account the sizes of your header, bitmap and the blocksize of the root directory when using fseek.

Hi

I finished rmdir but found something weird happened when I tested the outcome volume 
on web viewer. when I remove the last directory of the parent directory, it works 
fine. But when I try to removed other directories of the parent directory,the bitmap 
remains correctly but after I click the blocks, it can not show the information, and 
the hierarchy disappeared. I tried different ways but still can not solve the problem.

The idea of my rmdir is to use fseek to find the position of the removed block and 
rewrite it by an initialized oneblock with all 0. Also change the information in the 
bitmap and parent directory.

Would the order of changing the information in the volume affect the result? Sorry for 
long script. Any help would be appreciated.

cheers

Not sure if this will help you but for me I experienced the same issue and I found that the 
error was that i wasn't updating the entries array of the parent directory correctly. Instead 
of just removing the corresponding element from the entries array, you have to also shuffle 
down all values 1 spot down so there are no gaps. Not sure if that's obvious but I wasn't 
aware at first.

No easy answer;  this is a problem befalling the sifs-viewer, too.

One way to help solve this I saw was to have a goto CLEANUP; line for every error where CLEANUP would free the memory and close the file and return 1. Would this be poor style, are there betters ways of going about this?

A cleanup() function would work, but you'd then either need global variables for your allocated pointers, or a consistent way to pass the pointers to cleanup().
No easy, general, answer.

As Frinze has helpfully replied, you don't need to squeeze things up.

However, if you choose not to squeese up the directory entries and empty file entries, then 
you'll need to make sure that you iterate over all SIFS_MAX_ENTRIES (rather than just nentries), 
and ensure you have a mechanism to detect the 'holes' - all of which makes it sounds easier to 
squeeze directory and file entries, but not datablocks.

The meaning/use of a pathname is the same for all of the library functions you need to write.
It is of the form:

  /a/b/c/d

where a, b, and c are the names of existing directories within and below the root-directory, and d is the name of a specific leaf 
directory or file that you wish to add or remove.

The problem is really mine;  sifs-viewer needs to better detect and report invalid/corrupt 
volumes  (such as in your example, where blocksize and nblocks were both zero!)

A datablock is an array of characters, header.blocksize in length, that holds either a whole 
(short) file's contents, of part of a (longer) file's contents.

The viewer shows them in purple and, if you click on one, the viewer adds a tick to the file/owner 
of the datablock.

Not sure what you mean by "add to...the end of the SIFS volume".
Once created, the volume always has a fixed size, and any new file has to be added using 
sufficient unused blocks.

The data parameter is a pointer to memory holding the conetns of the file to be written.

Used exactly like the 2nd and 3rd parameters of the standard write() system-call:

  man 2 write

Hi Chris, sorry for being unclear, I wanted to clarify that for directories and files we add these 
to the first "unused" block after BLOCK ID0, since they only occupy only 1 block size, however, for 
data blocks since they can be in multiple blocks(e.g. 3-4 blocks) these should be added to the last 
block which is not "unused" which is what I incorrectly meant by end of the SIFS volume which should 
be the end of a bunch of not "unused" blocks. So do the data blocks from the same file need to be in 
the same continuous block space like one after another or can the data blocks from the same file be 
scattered any where in the SIFS volume as long as there is a closes "unused" block nearest to BLOCK 
ID0. Thanks.

Hi Chris

I am struggling to get the correct inputs in the command line. I enter 4 inputs and 
my test program assigns 4 values. However, it keeps giving me an error in the 
command line. Why might this be?

E.g.

./sifs_writefile vol1 /a/b sifs.h 1000

Is this how we do it?

If data is a buffer for the file, do we need to copy the memory of that file into some array, and then pass that array into the sifs 
function?

to add:

*volume is the volume (e.g. vol1)
*data is the file (e.g. sifs.h)
nbytes is the size of *data (e.g. 100)

for pathname, If I have a directory called "sub1" then is the following valid? 

./sifs_writefile vol1 sub1/file1 sifs.h 1000

I am confused about the pathname because a file block doesn't have a name like the dir 
block did.

The error was in using strncpy instead of strcpy.
With strncpy you need to manually add the null pointer to the end of the string which I 
failed todo.
Hope this helps anyone with the same issue.

What are you trying to do with this line?

fread(&rootdir_block, header.blocksize, 1 ,fp);

I think this may be you issue rootdir_block != header.blocksize you need to use the 
size of the rootdir_block

Thanks for the reply.

I fixed it and it compiles and runs fine but when I upload the vol to the viewer it 
creates a segementation 11 error ont he root directory. Any reason why? I tried

char oneblock[header.blocksize]
SIFS_DIRBLOCK rootdir_block;
for loop () to update root entries

memset(oneblock,0, sizeof block) //set all to zero
memcpy(oneblock, &rootdir_block, sizeof rootdir_block); //copy dir into oneblock

fseek(fp, sizeof header + sizeof bitmap, SEEK_SET); //start writing at root block
fwrite(oneblock,sizeof oneblock,1,fp); // write the block to vol
memset(oneblock,0,sizeof oneblock) // reset to 0

This code here is causing the error somewhere. Because, without it the dir will be 
implemented into bitmap fine, just when i try and update the root i get this error.

I'm pretty sure that sizeof bitmap is wrong.

Try something like and look at what the sizes are:

printf("This sizeof bitmap is: &li\n", sizeof header);
printf("This sizeof bitmap is: &li\n", sizeof bitmap);

I fixed it!

When I was fseeking the block dir i was adding, I didnt put i * blocksize into brackets so 
its was basically saying (sizeof(headeR) + sizeof(bitmap) + 1) * 1024 which of course 
overflows the memory.

You can't use "sifs.h" as a value to the parameter *data. Data needs to point to a buffer

I am currently trying to finish up read file and have begun testing it by printing out the 
pointer from fread(data, *nbytes, 1, fp). My print function is by using %p and then (void 
*). Am I doing something wrong with my pointers in the fread or does printing out void 
usually output some hexadecimal things instead of the normal char datatype which I have 
inputted into the file.

Hi
As for writefile program. IF we want to detect the whether the input file is existed 
in the volume or not, do we just simply see if there is a same file name in the volume 
or not?if exists then return 1 and reports the error of the file already existed . 
if so, what about entering a duplicated file into the volume, should we assume that we 
are knowing the file is duplicated in the volume? like ./sifs_writefile vol 
/sif.h_copy sif.h 1000
cheers

use fseek to find the beginning position of the bitmap in the volume. then using 
fread(bitmap,sizeof bitmap,1,vol) to read and store the bitmap information.

Yes, you'll need to determine the file's size, allocate dynamic memory of that size, read the file into that memory, and pass it to the function.

Classic answer - you need 30/60 to pass the exam

A file's data-blocks need to be stored contiguously - storing a file requiring 6 blocks must first find 6 unused 
blocks in a sequence.

Think about the problem - if those 6 blocks could be scattered, individually, anywhere in the volume, you'd also 
require a mechanism/table to record where those 6 blocks are.

Using %p requests that the pointer's *value* is printed, as a hexadecimal number.
This is very different to attempting to print out the data *pointed to* by that pointer.

If the file already exists (with the identical pathname), that's an error.
If the doesn't exist, good, then either store it as a brand new file-block and data-blocks if no 
other existing file-block indicates the same MD5 checksum.

You can't simply know/assume that a duplicate file exists, you'll need to check that.

readfile() is just the opposite to writefile(), with its parameters performing the role (but in 
reverse).

Write a test application program to call readfile(), which is executed as:

   ./sifs_getfile  volumename  pathname-in-volume  output-name-on-my-harddisk

Yes.

(but get the word 'append' out of your head - it'll have you imagining things that our

In the library function SIFS_writefile(), the parameter *data is a pointer to a buffer of memory holding 
the files contents. It is not referring to a file name.

As such, you cannot just pass the file name straight to your library function. 

Instead in your sifs_writefile() testing function try (in the same way you have been reading the volume 
for each function); 

    - first fopen() the file you are wanting be written to the volume (i.e. "sifs.h")
    - read, for the size of "sifs.h", the contents of "sifs.h" into a buffer that has already been
      allocated the correct amount of memory
    - pass this buffer to your library function SIFS_writefile() as the *data parameter

For your second question, yes that is a perfectly valid pathname. It should create a file named 
"file1" under sub1 with the contents of "sifs.h"

One more thing to add, you should only be passing 3 command line inputs to your testing function 
(volumename, pathname, data). You should workout the number of bytes within your testing program, and 
then pass this value to your library function (look up ftell()).

Hope you get it working!

the submissions had failed the tests because they were not producing the output in the 
format specified by the project sheet.

You may like to recheck your mark;  no marks have gone down, and the average for all 
submitted projects is now up to 29.2/40

You may download a shellscript to test your own project against the 9 tracefiles used for 
testing from:

    http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/projects/testproj1.zip

Download and unpack the Zip archive, and then run  ./testproj1.sh

Remember that your project, as submitted, may have been corrected/modified so that it could 
be compiled and marked, or to produce the required output format.  You may have lost a mark 
or two (/2), depending on how many changes were required.

You can also see the feedback from students who completed the end-of-project survey, at:

    http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/feedback/2019/project1-feedback/

And in answer to the concerns that 40 students received zero for the project, it's because 
they did not submit a project; 31 of those did not sit the mid-semester test, either, and 
have not yet withdrawn.

I am having trouble executing this file properly. I have attempted the following:

1. fopen the volume
2. fseek and fread the header and bitmap

At this point I have done the following 

SIFS_DIRBLOCK *dir = malloc(sizeof dir);
fseek and fread the dir block to check if it contains the pathname.
Then the hard part comes. Once the pathname = dir->name I attempted the following:

char ** entries = malloc(SIFS_MAX_ENTRIES * sizeof(char*));
for loop using malloc to assign entries[i] memory.

//I am not sure how to assign the dir entries to the entries pointer.

*entrynames = nentries
*nentries = dir->nentries;
*modtime = dir->modtime;
return 0;

Is this on the right track. Some help and clarification would be appreciated by 
anyone.

In SIFS_writefile(), this gives me a nonsense md5 ??:+?l???"???. What is the correct way to

An array of characters is being correctly passed to data from my sifs_writefile.c program.

thanks for your help.
I just checked the writefile.c, was I correct to think that "data" like an array stores all the content of

So this block of code above. From my understating a double pointer is initialised and 
allocated memory on the heap. The for loop goes through and allocates the array of 
pointers onto heap. Then after that how do we assign each index of a pointer the 
required string? Simply doing below:

entries[0] = dir.entries[0] or entries[i] = dir.entries[i] (for loop) does not work 
because its incompatible types (structure type vs *char type). This leads to my 
question. How do we get the information if its not the same type as the double pointer 
(char)? The way we have been extracting information is using structures such as 
dir.name etc.

Much appreciated if anyone can help.

You *are* calculating the MD5 correctly;
your mistake is in trying to print the digest as a string, when it is not a string.

{{{
unsigned char newMD5[MD5_BYTELEN];

// this is correct, leaving the digest in 'newMD5':  
MD5_buffer(data, nbytes, newMD5);

// and then you can print the digest if needed:  
printf("md5 %s\n", MD5_format(newMD5) );
}}}

In the SIFS volume, the digests are to be stored as their MD5_BYTELEN length arrays,
and not as MD5_STRLEN+1 length strings.

Then, again because they are not strings, we cannot copy or compare them with strcpy() and strcmp(),
but must use memcpy() and memcmp().

so you mean the void* data is a char array holding the whole content of the written file, and nbytes is the size of 
the written file. 
and this two-parameter should be calculated in the main function(testing program), right?

Sorry to clear a few things up.

So I a valid input in command line should look like this:

./sifs_writefile vol1 sub1/file1 "name of file"

I have been passing the 4 arguments as SIFS_writefile(volumename, pathname, data, nbytes)

However how do I pass in the nbytes or set it? It gives me error when ever I try compile saying nbytes is not 
initialised. Do we have to get the size of the file before we pass the values into the libray function?

So we first open the data file, check the size assign it to nbytes = sizeof data file and then pass into the 
library function?

Just clarifying I'm understanding it right?

Hi Chris, 

What is the output-name-on-my-harddisk for? 

Are we to copy the data (file content) passed back by the readfile() into output-name-on-my-
harddisk?
If yes, does it mean we need to fopen to write in the test application program?

Thanks.

Hold on, what parameters are we supposedly passing to the function?
Would it be something like:

./sifs_writefile volumename dir1/dir2/file.c

or

./sifs_writefile volumename dir1/dir2 file.c

Because if it's the latter, how do we find the filename if we're only passing the data and the length of the file to 
the function?

I thought it was the latter.

I thought data is the file in which we read in and add to volume under a data_block. I thought the same thing as you. How 
do we get the name of the file? I was thinking maybe if we write an argument like this:

./sifs_writefile vol1 sub1/file.c file.c

If this is right, then we can write the file.c into the name and also read the contents too.

Im currently working on rmdir and im not sure how to remove an entry from the parent

how to set it to that. Ive tried setting that entry and that entry.blockID to null, 
but both gives me compile errors. 


ive tried
parentBlockPointer->entries[entryToRemove].blockID = NULL;
and 
parentBlockPointer->entries[entryToRemove]= NULL;

which gives 

assignment makes integer from pointer without a cast [-Werror=int-conversion] 
and

As i dont think arbritrary numbers work, -1 definitely screws the whole thing up, im

fread(a,1,sizeof a, vol);
printf("%s",a)

where a is char a[1000];

Hello Chris,

I am just wondering, are the provided pathnames (for testing) going to be absolute 
or relative? Also, will the name of the directory/file to be created be provided in 
the pathname? For example, if relative, will the pathname be (starting in the root 
directory):

subdir2/subdir3/file8 

Where file8 is the new file to be created in that specific location 
(rootdirectory/subdir2/subdir3).

Thank you.

A few people have used it and some have opted not. Strtok() is useful in splitting 
the pathanme into tokens. So each word within the slashes can be a token that 
represents the sub directories and file.

e.g. /a/b/c

token 1 = a
token 2 = b
token 3 = c 

works for any length. You can also use strtok to get just the last word.

You were on the right track, just use the address of the header instead of an array 
a. Then simply get the struct values via header.blocksize and header.nblocks.

Hope this helps :)

I managed to successfully create a file and data blocks within a directory. But the data blocks don't 
seem to be correct (it's just a bunch of numbers then a whole lot of null bytes). Because we have to 
split the memory of the file's data depending on the fixed block size, I'm a little unsure how I can 
divide the memory of the data, then writing it into the volume without altering it. Can anyone suggest a 
way to tackle this problem?

Basically what I did is n = (nbytes/header.blcoksize)+1

Then I created a for loop that each iteration created a data_block array (can use oneblock) , added the 
header.blcoksize of data, and wrote it to the vol, then cleared the data_block. Basically, the thing here is 
every loop you need to keep track of fseek() offset. So its starts at 0, then it wills tart at 
header.blocksize * 1 and then header.blocksize * 2 and so on depending on size of nbytes of course.

The null bytes are normal, because the last data block wont contain all full data. It might only need 100 
bytes and then the rest is filled with null bytes to fill the block.

Hope that makes sense.

The pathname is a pathname *in the volume*, not on your OS's file-system.
The volume's pathname tells writefile where to add the incoming data, not where to get it from.

A typical test program may be similar to the cp command:

   ./sifs_cp  volumename  localfilename-source  volumepathname-destination

That still leaves me hanging with the question of how we're supposed to pass the filename of the file into the 
function if the filename is separate to the pathname.

I know the pathname is where to store the file, But like others have said how do we store the name? Say the cocmmand 
line looks like this:

./sifs_writefile vol /sub1/file1 sifs.h

My understanding is we are going to write the sifs.h into a file, into a sub directory called sub1 which is in root. 
However, how do we actually get the name of the file? File1 is not the name of the file.

When I assign the name of the file to the file.filenames[i] and then test by priting 
it out after it prints fine. However on the viewer it displays an empty string. 

For example:

file.modtime = time (&now);
file.length = nbytes;
file.blockID = i + 1;
file.nentries = 1;
for (int i = 0; i < nentres; i++){
    strcpy(file.filenames[i],str); //str is null terminated
}

But when I upload to the viewer everything is there correctly except the filenames. It 
just shows an empty string.

Any reason or help would be appreciated.

Sorry, this is still a bit vague to me. What do you mean by reverse? I'm still not sure what readfile 
is supposed to do. Does it give the contents of the file as the output, or something like that?

So my issue was file.filenames[i] was actually not right. It needed to be j not i.

I have a for loop for bitmap that uses i and then another that uses j for filenames.

So it was file.filenames[j] not file.filenames[i].

So writefile() needs to put a file into a path requested. So then readfile() needs to get the requested path 
and print out the files(s).

It's very identical to mkdir.c and dirinfo.c

It is my understanding that the parameter 'pathname' is what holds the information on where you should be adding the file AND 
what the file is to be called.

The last component of 'pathname' is always the files name. Take for example the following pathnames:

    dir/subdir/file.txt   ---->   Should create a file named file.txt under subdir (i.e. rootdir->dir->subdir->file.txt)
    
    file1.txt             ---->   Should create a file named file1.txt under the root directory (i.e. rootdir->file1.txt)

Yep thats what I thought in the end.

So if a pathname for example /sub1/file.txt

We have to first update the root dir, and then using sub find the dir that contains sub as the name and store the entry fileindex in 
there? The of course add the file and data blocks.

With your testing program, yes print it out there to make sure it works. Pretty much what we want to do is within 
the vol, get me the contents of the pathname. So if that pathname is /sub1/file.txt, get me the contents of 
file.txt. In the readfile.c it will pass the contents to the caller.

e.g.

Sifs_readfile(vol /sub1/file.txt)

Will hopefully present me with contents of the file.txt.

Hope that helps.

I am just writing writefile.c and I was wondering how far we need to search looking for duplicate files? Do we simply look in the same directory for files with the same MD5 hash or do we search the entire file system? 

I assume the former because otherwise we would have to store some path for where duplicated files were originally stored in the file system, which the current project structure does not allow for.

As an example say we had the following structure :

---sifs.h (md5 : 8a32e905ed5315f4cf4c8b218f14b039)
---subdir
------anotherfile.h (md5 : 57fs5dh4j72h15f4cf4c8b21af14b039)

If we wished to store a new file with path /subdir/sifs-copy.h which had the same MD5 hash as sifs.h but was stored one directory lower on the tree would we store it as a duplicate of sifs.h or as a new file in subdir?

I think you have to store the content of the objected file in the volume to as a file actually exists in your computer 
disk,maybe print out is not necessary. I wondering do we need to check if there is a file with the same name already exists 
in your disk then rewrite it with the content in the volume or end with return an error of file already exist?

Maybe you don’t need to update the root directory because you are creating a new file in  a subdirectory under the root directory so all you need 
to do is updating the information in the sub1. Also you have to first check if there is a same file name in the same directory and report it as 
file exists error

I mean depends you might write a file /file.txt which suggest you are writing to the root. So you will need to update. Otherwise if its /sub1/file.txt

A directory only contains the informations directly belongs to that directory.it is not necessary to check the information of  a higher level directory when you 
write a file in the sub directory. But you have to update the information in that sub directory which is sub1 in this case

Hi,

If there is a duplicate of a file like in Chris' example vol C, and the user has asked to 
delete sifs.h-copy, does filenames[1] become unused? or does the entire file and the 
datablocks get removed?


  filenames[ 0] = "sifs.h"
  filenames[ 1] = "sifs.h-copy"


In other words, if nfiles > 1, do we just remove the file from filenames array or remove 
the whole file?

Thanks

They would, but my question is more about how true a reflection of the original file system our file system should be. Extending Chris' example from the workshop where we talked about this I would expect someone to use this programme as a way of backing up their data. If the original file system were to be deleted and it needed to be restored from this SIFS, storing all duplicate files together would destroy the original hierarchy of the files and produce a file system different from the one used to create the SIFS.

First of all you wouldn't be allowed to remove subdir1 as it isn't empty (SIFS_errno = 
SIFS_ENOTEMPTY). For empty directories the way I did it was to find the blockID with a name 
that matches the pathname, and then remove its contents from the volume.

3. Is data just the contents of the file? Would the sifs testing file then just print the

In the parent directory, move the last (in use) directory to the index that's being removed, and then 
decrement the number of entries.  Leave no 'gaps' in the entry array.

Careful as, for example,  if nbytes was 20,000 and blocksize was 2,000 then you'd be using 11 blocks.

Yes.
With the help of the SIFS_readfile() function you'll be able to copy a file from within the volume to your 
operating system's hard disk.
Just like recovering from a backup.

Unsure why you'd want to print it out character-by-character.
The code I've provided, above, prints it as a single string.

(can can look at the code of MD5_format(), in the library, to see how it works)

Presumably you have   int *path = ....

But why do you want a vector of integers, and then allocate space proportional to the size of characters?

You can only free() memory that 'came from' previous calls to malloc(), realloc(), calloc(), or strdup().
You cannot free any other pointer value,  nor a pointer that has since moved from the address assigned to it at 
allocation time.

Just remove the file's name from the array of all names, decrement the count of duplicates,
and if now none left remove the file-entry.

Your testing function should only make a copy of the volume's file to your OS's disk.

If it's not a file of plain text - it may be a GIF image, for example - then printing the file's 
contents (as if it were text) would not make sense.

Attempting to write a second instance of, say, "/a/b/filename" - even if it had a different MD5 - would be an error, anyway, as files cannot be updated, only added 
(once) and removed.

So for the entrynames. I have started with the following:

**char e = malloc(SIFS_MAX_ENTRIES * sizeof(char));

for (int i = 0; i < SIFS_MAX_ENTRIES; i ++){
    e[i] = malloc(SIFS_MAX_ENTRIES * sizeof(char));
}

So if I do a for loop over the directories enteries. How do I assign the entries to 
the new char array? Because the following is incorrect:

e[i] = dir.enteries[i];
memcpy(e[j],&dir.entries[i], sizeof (dir.entries[i]))

How do I make the types compatible?

The SIFS_dirinfo() function is not returning directory entries; it's returning the *names* of 
directory entries, each of which may be a different length.

Your code will need to worry about those names, as strings, so the standard C string handling 
functions will help.

Yes; having two or more files (identical contents) owned by different directories is valid.

(the validator was incorrectly looking for exactly 1 directory, when it should have been detecting

Assuming that you will want/require some additional, common, functions, where were you planning

But to get the entries for a directory we have to assign it to a pointer don't we? In the 
dirinfo.c we assign *entrynames = (variable that stores entrynames). 

I'm not sure if the code above is on the right track or where it falls down?

The entries structure values are not chars so thats why I im getting confused since for string 
handling we need both parameters to be char?

Sorry if that sounds confusing I'm struggling to wrap my head around it.

Well for example if I want to open the volume. Its like 7-8 lines of code that will be repeated in every 
single sifs Library file. In real life I would probably chucked it in some common file and called them from 
there. But due to time limits on the project I would rather copy/paste it from across all files if we will 
not lose any marks for it

I would just like to chime in here and say that that is a terrible idea. Imagine you decide to change the way you open volumes (I did), you have to work your way through all of your code to find all the times you opened a volume and change it. I'm sure you can appreciate that that is a lot of times.

The attitude of "I don't have time to do things properly so I'm going to hack together a solution" will result in some serious bugs in this project, and indeed pretty much any project more complex than a simple "Hello, world!" program.

If you really wanted a minimal effort solution that still used external functions I suggest this the following:

Add the following line to sifs-internal.h or equivalent for your implementation:

{{{
extern FILE * open_volume(const char*);
}}}

And then create a file called helper.c (or whatever, I'm not a cop) and put the following inside it:

{{{
#include "sifs-internal.h"

FILE * open_volume(const char* volumename) {
    // your implementation here
}

}}}

Please not that this is not the best possible way of breaking functions out into a separate file, but it is the easiest way I am aware of.

1.strcpy(%block.name(sizeof pathname),pathname);
2.memcpy(block.name,pathname,sizeof &pathname);
3.memcpy(&block.name,pathname,sizeof &pathname)

and this is how I write a block to volume:
seek(vol,i*(sizeof block),SEEK_CUR)(i is the number of blocks before this block )
fwrite(&block,1,sizeof block,vol);

does anyone know how to solve this problem?

Use fseek(fp,sizeof header + sizeof bitmap + (i + header.blocksize),SEEK_SET)

then  use fwrite() into the volume.

Thank you for replying.
But the problem is...I can't write those information to the volume..
I also tried create a char oneblock(header.blocksize) and then memcpy(unblock,&block,sizeof 
block),then write oneblock to the volume
it still couldn't work..

This should write the contents into one block on the volume.

User programs would basically do the following: 

{{{

void write_file_to_volume(char* filename, char *volumename) {
   FILE * file = fopen(filename, "r");
   void *ptr;
   fread(ptr, sizeof(OURFILE), 1, file);
   SIFS_writefile(volumename, "/dir1/blah.c", ptr, sizeof(OURFILE));
} 

}}}


You can see we just read the contents of whatever file we're trying to write and allocate it to a void pointer which is then passed to the function. The SIFS_writefile doesn't care where the file is on disk, it's not its responsibility to go out and find it, extract its contents and read it, that responsibility falls to the application program. The level of abstraction we are allowed to assume in writing this function is that there is a void pointer to some data which needs to be written to a file called blah.c and that we need to put it in the directory dir1, where that data comes from is none of the function's concern. 

Please note the code I wrote above will not run as I have not checked which order the arguments are supposed to be provided, and also I have abstracted the finding out of the size of the file because that would needlessly complicate the example and I really can't be bothered typing it out.

Can we just get away with swapping the element that has to be removed and last element in the array and 
decrementing? or we have to keep order the same (ie swap them and then put them in the order that the were before 
minus the element). Because if I have 3 elements lets say 29, 30, 31 and I decide to delete 29, it will rearrange 
my array to be 31,30

You are reading the block into a char array,

Edward's rely is good one;  it'll take you 10 minutes to create a file of common functions, and add it to the Makefile.

But to clarify a point in your comment - you don't lose marks for doing something poorly; you gain marks for doing 
something well.  "In real life" and in CS projects.

It's just data - it has no specific format, and you shouldn't assume that it's human-readable text.

There's many ways to test your library functions without printing things.
For example, you can test writing and reading a file by using 2 simple test programs and then comparing inputs and 
outputs:

{{{
  ./sifs_putfile  volumename  /subdir/myimage.jpg  from-my-harddisk-originalimage.jpg

  ./sifs_getfile  volumename  /subdir/myimage.jpg  to-my-harddisk-recovered.jpg

  md5sum  from-my-harddisk-originalimage.jpg  to-my-harddisk-recovered.jpg    # files should have same MD5
}}}

(on Linux, the command is just named 'md5')

The logic for doing this has been explained here:

  https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help2002?p=np&a=1036

(and in other threads).  However, instead of allocating memory to hold the
lines of a text file, you're needing to store the names of a directory's
entries.  You do not store/allocate/copy the entries themselves, just
the names of the files and subdirectories that are each in the volume's
blocks indicated by the entry's blockID field.

(I really cannot answer this question, again, in any other way)

As far as I'm aware this is the code from mkvolume.c that creates all the blocks where the

Hey,
    So in my sifs_writefile file, I am trying to set the data pointer to point to 
the whole file that will be written into the volume (sifs.h in this case).
However, since data is of type void*, I can't seem to either read the file into the

    char *filename = get_name(pathname);
    FILE *openfile = fopen(filename, "r");

    fseek(openfile, 0, SEEK_END);
    int filesize = ftell(openfile);
    data = malloc(filesize*sizeof(int));
    fseek(openfile, 0, SEEK_SET);
    fread(data, sizeof(data), 1, openfile);

If data is a pointer  (you haven't shown us), then the sizeof(data) will be the size of that 
point:  8.
So, you're only reading in 8 bytes.

Also, why do you allocate space based on integers, when you're only using chars?

Don't use the word 'folder' for this project;  it creates confusion.
Use the words directories, files, and data-blocks - suggest that you re-read the project sheet.

Hopefully for the last time - a volume is not a text file.  !!

How did you determine that the block was unused?
Suggest you change that value from 'unused' to 'directory', and update it in the volume.

The function creates a new file in the volume, if it can, and writes the data into several data-blocks.

Have you actually implemented any of the SIFS_mkdir() function, recompiled it, and linked the library with the 
test program or, guessing here, is it not yet implemented?

From: poster039@student.uwa.edu.au

Just want to double check my understanding of write file.

In our testing file:
- open requested file
- malloc an array by finding the size of the file to store the contents of the file (data)
- read the requested file into the malloc-ed array
- pass array and size of file to library file (data and nbytes)

In library file:
- use the data (contents of file) to find the md5 of our file
- see if the file exists already at the pathname, check with md5
- if it does exist - add our file name to the filenames array, update all relevant mod times and nentries
- if it does not exist - add file to bitmap, etc.

Is this correct?

Thanks

Hey,
   I can't believe I missed the sizeof(data) part...

I'm not sure, for some reason I thought it'd be easier to use integers, but I guess I'll change 
it to characters.

This is what I currently have:

    // Initialise data
    void *data = NULL;

    // Open file
    char *filename = get_name(pathname);
    FILE *openfile = fopen(filename, "r");

    // Read file into data
    fseek(openfile, 0, SEEK_END);
    int filesize = ftell(openfile);
    data = malloc(filesize*sizeof(char));
    fseek(openfile, 0, SEEK_SET);
    fread(data, filesize*sizeof(char), 1, openfile);
    for (int i=0 ; i<filesize ; ++i) {
        printf("%c\n", data[i]);
    } 

Since writefile requires a void* type parameter, does that necessarily mean I need to give it  
a void* variable? Or can I initalise data as a character pointer and just pass writefile that 
instead?

Only because you're trying to print 'void things', as characters.
You similarly won't be able to print (see) binary files, anyway.

So there's a case when there's two files that have different names, but both point to the same data blocks and are also under the same file block. What determines which file goes into which block? Because I tried to put a file that had the same md5 (not sure if md5 digests are relevant, because I was told it doesn't matter) and same data, but that just made the parent directory point to the file block twice instead of creating an individual file. I'm not sure what's going on and why this happens.

Would we need to shuffle down the values in the filenames array to avoid gaps (like with the 
entries array of the parent directory)? Or can we have gaps and simply employ a "fill up the 
first empty spot" technique.

Hi,

I've been testing md5 in terminal and get the following for sifs.h

MD5 (sifs.h) = 09c5e6931a22aab60edf9c0ac571bee2


However, on the sifs-viewer, the md5 value for "sifs.h" is different.


I have not edited the sifs.h file from the zip file provided.


Is the sifs.h file in sifs-viewer different to what was provided in the zip file?


I got the same md5 in terminal as what is in the sifs-viewer for sifs_mkvolume.c so I'm not 
sure if the incorrect md5 for sifs.h is my fault or something else.


Thanks

Hi

I have some doubts and want to ask, how to do SIFS_mkdir?  What is its main logic?  Do I 
need to consider the subdirectory of the directory?  Then if the data byte exceeds the 
size of the block, is it stored in the next block?

Thanks

Hi Chris,

I just had a quick question on how the MD5 is stored in the SIFS_FILEBLOCK.

I can see that md5 is an array of unsigned chars and the array has MD5_BYTELEN 
elements. My question is when we write a file to the volume we are supposed to store 
what is returned by MD5_buffer, correct? And then to compare the MD5 of two 
SIFS_FILEBLOCKs we would use strcmp between the results returned by calling MD5_format 
on the two MD5s. I just want to ensure I am on the right track before getting too deep 
in it.

Hi there, 
I've read somewhere on the forum that when we delete directory from the volume we have to 
update the bitmap. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find this post, to reread it, but did it 
mean literally update that array element to unused, or update as in make it unused and 
bring it to the back of the bitmap.
Sorry, haver trouble explaining my idea. 
But what I literary mean, if we want to delete "dir" from the following bitmap
d d d dir d d d (d - are all the other directories untouched by rmdir) 
should it make it to 
d d d unused d d d 
or 
d d d d d d unused

I understood it at first as  
d d d d d d unused 
and tried implementing it and its seems like a quite a mission to do it

Thanks in advance!

Can someone lead me in the right direction to use md5. Completely lost in how to use it.

When I read the md5 why can't we just use MD5_file(data);

I just get random symbols.

Hi

When uploading a volume to the viewer it did not load and the validator says that

All I did was download volB, wrote a file to the volume and uploaded it to the viewer.

I didn't change header.nblocks and can't seem to figure out why the viewer would say 
nblocks is 0.

Has anyone else experienced this?

I'm wondering how we get the result returned in the command prompt.

For examples, When looping through my bitmap if the bitmap is full it will print the 
error SIFS_error = SIFS_ENOSPC; then returned 1.

However when I run the program it doesn't appear with the message. I was wondering why 
this might be happening. I tested it with a print statement before it and that prints 
out on the command prompt however the error does not.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

and if you do current_directory = strtok(null, separator); again will it return a null

Hi everyone

My understanding of readfile is to write the contents of a file that is within the volume 
into another file (on hard disk for example).

Is this done by reverse engineering md5 to get the contents of the file? If so I'm unsure 
how to do this? Are we meant to use MD5_file?

Well, its just testing some stuff such as the size of the volume. As you know, when 
you're making a volume, you already specify the size the whole volume is going to 
take (nblocks and blocksize) so you could find out the expected value

it presents that error, because you decremented nfiles, but never shifted the one FROM INDEX 
POSITION 1 to INDEX POSITION 0 ... in this case, your array is never being scanned because you 
reduced the "size of" (nfiles), but you never shifted file2 to index 0

Have you thought that maybe, just maybe there's a chance that you didn't use fseek when 
writing a file? In effect, it overwritten the first couple of lines in the volume

DO NOT DO THAT, it should be "> d d d unused d d d " ... The process you're referring to is 
defragmentation, and it is covered in the sifs_defrag()

See this image for more clarity about defragmentation

ummm, a directory is empty when it is created hence will only occupy 1 block... i believe 
you're referring to SIFS_writefile() regarding data block not directory block

According to what i see in the image, it means your file is bigger than expected... It 
could only make me think of one thing... when you're adding a directory or file... do you 
calculate the offset of the unused block or append it??

I presume you're appending it...

Take a look at this code from the mkvolume.c
{{{
    fwrite(oneblock, sizeof oneblock, 1, vol); // write rootdir
    memset(oneblock, 0, sizeof oneblock);      // reset to all zeroes
    for (int b = 1; b < nblocks; ++b)
    {
        fwrite(oneblock, sizeof oneblock, 1, vol);
    }
}}}

As you can see with the loop, it is creating empty spaces to allocate some spaces for the 
"unused block"... you might not be able to see this when you open it in text file...

you can only see this if you perform an octal dump. see https://geek-
university.com/linux/octal-dump/

OR see this ... Take a close look at the line numbers on the side... you'll see that the 
numbers drastically change

when adding a file into our volume, it requires the file block, and the n datablocks to be added, I know that the n datablocks need to be contiguous in order to be added, but does the file block also need to be contiguous with the datablocks? If that makes any sense?

please take a look at this from 
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_strtok.htm
{{{
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main () {
   char str[80] = "This is - www.tutorialspoint.com - website";
   const char s[2] = "-";
   char *token;
   
   /* get the first token */
   token = strtok(str, s);
   
   /* walk through other tokens */
   while( token != NULL ) {
      printf( " %s\n", token );
    
      token = strtok(NULL, s);
   }
   
   return(0);
}

}}}

if you technically have a counter to determine how many entries there are... you could... 
take a look at the print statement before token = strtok(NULL,s) ... that never prints out 
null... although token does have a final value of null... maybe before token is reassigned 
a value ... you could copy it somewhere

I dont think so, because the fileblock itself has information about where the first datablock is

Hi, you must be new to the forum style of getting answers. I would like to politely ask, before 
posting questions, please do search the forum first for answer because it will create less 
clutter on the search and also be faster in responses, because when you post a question, you 
still have to wait for someone to read then answer your question.

With that said, here's the resource you're looking for 
https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help2002?p=np&a=800&all=y8

If this doesn't cover everything. What you have to do is define a pointer to point something to 
the memory.

Use fseek to locate at which portion  you are reading/writing

Use fread ... read the description of fread

Definitely(to make sure it fits before you write stuff)... Just that one of the block 
(fileblock), doesn't need to be contiguous

"Fill up gaps" technique only applies for bitmap stuff... filenames does not take a bitmap... so 
you do have to shift the items to the left (if this is what you call "shuffle").

See this to see what the effect of not "shuffling" the values in the filename array

->>>> "sizeof header.blocksize" this is whats wrong... this is equal to the SIZE OF THE

So that means we need to create a new file to store the data correct?
If so, what should we do in terms of error handling if the file pointer returns NULL as there doesn't 
appear to be an error statement to reflect this situation (eg no space on disk, no write permission in 
current directory, etc).

I created  a file block which contains duplicated file,names "file1","file2".After doing the

No, this is not a bug in the sifsviewier. From the looks of it, you did shift the names from the 
filename which is correct... but you never shifted the "fileindex" from the directory block

In other words, you corrected the order of filenames in fileblock, but not the fileindex in 
directory block

yes... that can happen if you have unused block before those files (happens upon

I think that is correct ... sifs.h is a child of dir2... dir2 is a child of dir1... dir1 is a child of the root

nope, and i dont think the segmentation error is happening there... segmentation error occurs for accessing wrong things (in simpler terms) ... rarely does it happen when declaring variables... an example that it might occur 
will be if I try to declare a ptr (initial value of ptr is NULL) then I try to print that, it might occur with segmentation error

A file's contents may not be a sequence of human-readable characters, so it can't have a general solution.
You can force a void pointer to a pointer to a char, with:

{{{
  char *ch = (char *)data;  
  printf("%c ", *ch);
}}}

but some characters are simply not printable this way.

Sorry, can't understand what you're asking.
All data-blocks are *not* the same in the viewer's sample volumes.

Ni; you cannot reverse (engineer?) an MD5 'back to' its original file - the MD5 is not a compression 
function, cannot be reversed, and is not unique (2 or more files *may* have the same MD5 - see 
Wikipedia).

You need to copy the data-blocks from the volume's files into memory that is 'passed back' to the 
calling function.

As Frinze has correctly replied, you only need to set the old bitmap entry to SIFS_UNUSED.
The other, more difficult activity, can be attempted as per the project's webpage.

You cannot use strcmp() to compare two characters; just use:

We don't know how you're accessing it, though I suspect you want

    dirblock.entries[0].blockID
or
    dirblock.entries[0].fileindex

but not a whole entry.  ??

Your function will likely only return NULL if the requested file does not exist or if memory can't be allocated - 
both of these already have error codes.

What I'm trying to say is that when I create a file, the data blocks are all the same, 
when I want them to be unique (I don't know how to explain it more thoroughly). So I was 
wondering how I can get different data blocks of a file instead of getting duplicates of 
the same data block.

Assuming all the data blocks are different when you've read them from your OS's hard-disk, perhaps 
you're writing the same block to the volume multiple times, or writing successive blocks of data to 
the same location.

Honestly cannot tell from the above, alone.

No, sifs_mkvolume.c is 2 blocks. I have the block size set to 1024.

Yes, that's the problem. I always seem to be writing the same data block to the volume instead of all data 
blocks. How do I get the other data blocks instead of getting the first data block multiple times?

That's right. I'm trying to access blockID like dirblock.entries[0].blockID for example.

I've not seen the "expression must have pointer-to-object type" error before;
perhaps show us the whole expression/line in which you're using it,
as you've only shown us the variable being accessed.

A typical use-case for both reading and writing is given in this example:

But it function MD5_buffer throws a segmentation error when the size goes to 1034 or higher, see attached photo.
Is this my miss use of MD5_buffer or is something else happening here?

More likely the 'data' pointer is not pointing to the indicated number of bytes (the file's contents).

Subject: Flaw In Sudo Enables Non-Privileged Users To Run Commands As Root 
From: chris.mcdonald@uwa.edu.au

And on the very day that we introduced this is a lecture :-)

https://linux.slashdot.org/story/19/10/14/2231235/flaw-in-sudo-enables-non-privileged-users-to-run-commands-as-root

"A vulnerability has been discovered in Sudo -- one of the most important, powerful, and commonly used utilities 
that comes as a core command installed on almost every UNIX and Linux-based operating system. The vulnerability in 
question is a sudo security policy bypass issue that could allow a malicious user or a program to execute arbitrary 
commands as root on a targeted Linux system even when the "sudoers configuration" explicitly disallows the root 
access. Sudo, stands for "superuser do," is a system command that allows a user to run applications or commands with 
the privileges of a different user without switching environments -- most often, for running commands as the root 
user. 

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2019-14287 and discovered by Joe Vennix of Apple Information Security, is more 
concerning because the sudo utility has been designed to let users use their own login password to execute commands 
as a different user without requiring their password. What's more interesting is that this flaw can be exploited by 
an attacker to run commands as root just by specifying the user ID "-1" or "4294967295." That's because the function 
which converts user id into its username incorrectly treats -1, or its unsigned equivalent 4294967295, as 0, which 
is always the user ID of root user. The vulnerability affects all Sudo versions prior to the latest released version 
1.8.28, which has been released today."

This is really stumping me. I don't understand why.

If I have the blocksize set to 1024, nblocks to 10. Then:

sifs_mkvolume.c (length 1162) works fine (requires 2 blocks)
sifs_readfile.c (length 1301) does not work (requires 2 blocks)

It's so strange that I have no idea why its happening.

Hey Chris,
         So I decided to just change the initialisation to char *data rather than void *data, but now when I 
catually pass the char* to the SIFS_writefile function in writefile.c, there are problems when I try to write 
in the datablocks...

for (int i=0 ; i<noblocks ; ++i) {
    char dblock[header.blocksize];
    for (int j=0 ; j<header.blocksize ; ++j) {
        dblock[j] = (char)data[j];
    }
}

Since data has gone back to beind void* (I think, since SIFS_writefile takes a void *data parameter), on the 
line "dblock[j] = (char)data[j];" i get errors saying "Invalid type conversion", "pointer of type ‘void *’ used 
in arithmetic", "dereferencing ‘void *’ pointer" and "invalid use of void expression".

I'm quite stuck as I can't think of any other way to create datablocks from the data parameter. I've tried 
memcpy/memset but I think the void* type messes these up as well.

Thanks, hopefully that all made sense

The path array stores the sub-fields of a dirname. For example is the input was /sub1/sub2 
then the path array is [sub1][sub2] so path[-1] is the last index, which is sub2. I was 
actually thinking does the size need to be + 1 to terminate it or is that for strings 
only?

No, an index of -1 provides the last array element in *Python*, but not in C.

So I managed to create all datablocks of a file that has the contents of sifs.h. The first few blocks 
look the same, but the last data block seems off. I tried to convert the void pointer into a char 
pointer so I could increment the pointer by block size. Why does the data block have a bunch of 
characters where the null bytes are supposed to be?

There is nothing wrong with that volume - provided that the length of the file in the (green) file-block is 
correct.  All of the extra 'rubbish' in the last data-block (the internal fragmentation) is not part of the file 
and, if you wanted that area to be filled with \0 bytes, then you'd need to explicitly write them there.

There is no specific meaning to a filename extension - any extension is a 'formal' part of the 
full filename.  If a filename has an extension, then you need to provide/name that extension 
to correctly identify the file.

I mean when our program will be tested, will can the file be deleted by rmfile /dir/file or we can assume 
that all files have some sort of extension? Because I am planning to drive some logic from "." character 
which seems reasonable from examples provided

These questions have be answered in this very thread.

And here's an example:  https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help2002?p=np&a=1456&flag=0

The testing of your project may, or may not, use files with extensions.
As stated, any extension is a part of its filename, and to treat '.' in any special way is incorrect.

1) For the writefile(), will the pathname look something like this: "/dir1/dir2/filename", where filename will obv be representing the file wanting to be added?

2) For the rmfile(), if we have a fileblock with >1 names and we delete one of those names, like the rmdir, do we replace that one we are deleting with the last entry? To make sure there is no gaps?

*All* pathnames, for all functions 'look' the same;  moreover, they look exactly like the pathnames used on your contemporary Unix-based systems.
It's the functions that determine what the pathname *means*, whether the last component is a file or a directory, whether it has to exist or is not allowed to exist.

As discussed, removing gaps from file-block entries is a good idea, though not essential.
In either case, (to remove gaps, or not) there will be some extra work to do to support your choice.

Hi, I need help what am I missing to add a directory to a volume.
When I test this all I get is:

-bash: ./sifs_mkdir: No such file or directory


Here is my code
FILE *vol = fopen(volumename, "r" );  

if(vol != NULL) {
    SIFS_VOLUME_HEADER  header;

    fread(&header, sizeof header, 1, vol);
    header.blocksize = blocksize;
    header.nblocks = nblocks;
	
    FILE *dir	=fopen(dirname, "w");
	
    fseek(dir, header.blocksize, header.nblocks);
	
fclose(vol);
fclose(dir);
}

Entrynames stores char pointers which themselves store chars. Thus entrynames should be allocated memory 
that allows them to store a particular number of char pointers. Thus the code should be
entrynames = malloc(sizeof(char *)*24)

Just to clarify something, when the user above stated:

- see if the file exists already at the pathname, check with md5

We are really supposed to check the entire volume, right? Then (if the file is anywhere 
in the volume) update the specified directory and add the new filename to the 
fileblock?

Are we also to assume that if a user tries to add a file that already exists, using a 
filename that is already used, we simply update the user-specified directory?

you can not read the directory use fopen since it is just the information in the 
volume. what you should do is reading the information from the volume and following 
the mkvolume to write back the directory information to the volume.

From: poster091@student.uwa.edu.au
X-smilie: ambivalent.png

Hello there, how should we handle a situation where a user tries to call a function 
with parameters that results in multiples errors. Obviously we return 1 and set 
SIFS_errno to some value, but which value should we set it to?
Is there a certain order in which errors should be assigned based on some priority or 
is any valid error applicable?
For example in the attached volume file (test) with 5 blocks each of size 1024 bytes 
and is completely full (root directory, 1 sub-directory and a file block in the sub-
directory that requires 2 data blocks), so if a user were to try something like 
./sifs_mkdir test dir1
This should trigger various errors such as SIFS_EMAXENTRY, SIFS_EEXIST, and 
SIFS_ENOSPC, therefore which error should be assigned first? 
What about another bad input such as:
./sifs_mkdir test abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890
In this case, the name is too long, but there's no more space and all the entries are 
full so which error should be returned?


Since the attached file is not working, the code to create a full volume was:
./sifs_mkvolume test 1024 5;
./sifs_mkdir test dir1;
./sifs_writefile test dir1/sifs_mkvolume.c sifs_mkvolume.c; (uses the sifs_mkvolume.c 
given in the project)

I am not Chris, but from the project outline under the notes "API functions do not print 
anything - even if they detect an error." ... In a sense, the library should not print 
anything but rather pass the error through global variable ERRNO.

About fileinfo, and dirinfo... their printing is handled by the tester application that 
uses that library through the use of the output pointers passed along to the API.

I am not sure, but I believe it should be SIFS_ENOENT (no such ...)

because if you think about it... "a/b/c" is technically a valid path ... the API just 
can't work on it because the preceding subdirectories do not exist

To add to the discussion, the blue guy with 4 diamonds is correct. `fopen` is only 
used for opening a file (in this case a volume, you're trying to read a volume)

... then later, you are going to write in the same volume...

To outline things that are missing:
1. Opening of Volume with Writer Option see `r+` in the documentation
2. You used `fseek`, but you havent used `fwrite` to create a directory
3. You haven't created an outline of what you are going to put in fwrite. Try to 
understand how mkvolume is created. It does the exact way of outlining the 
structures and writing.
4. The use of fseek is incorrect for all the 3 parameters. Read the documentation 
of fseek

There are a couple more tiny details, but these are the essential bit for mkdir.

Yes; we don't want the contents of any file to be stored twice, and need to keep track of all files 
(even when in different directories) that have the same contents.

Any particular commands?
All commands?
Tried invoking another terminal window - does the problem still happen there?

All are 'possible' and relevant, perhaps with the exception of SIFS_ENOTVOL.

Just return a reflection of the first error you find.
They do not have any priority and could be equally validly detected in different orders.

An example would be just making a volume.

/sifs_mkvolume vol 1024 10

this would say "Permission Denied"

You need to work on your descriptions of your problems.

"doesn't work"?  Does it still say "permission denied",
does the file "sifs_mkvolume" exist in the current directory, does the 'ls' command indicate if 
the file is executable?

With malloc()...

The other case is SIFS_ENOSPACE

Hi, may I know if we submit only the library folder or do we need to include the entire 
folder initially given to us, which include sifs.h, sits_mkvolume etc. Do we also include 
executables, objects, .a files or ONLY .c, .h and Makefile?

Hi Chris, With the above function, what is len?
Is is the length you want to result to be?
The size of the input file?
Ive found that when ever len is more then 1033 it will throw a segmetation error.

Sweet, thankyou.

Finally, if we try to add a file to a directory with a particular filename and the directory already has a 
copy of the file but the file itself does not contain that filename, do we add the filename to the file 
and update the directory with another entry to the same file?

Hi,

I am trying to write the readfile function and am getting stuck. Is this the correct 
approach:

Once we have found how many datablocks and the position of where the datablocks start, 
allocate memory for the data array (array to hold the contents of the datablocks).

Loop through the datablocks and strcat the contents of the datablocks to the data array.

Pass data array to testing file.



Is allocating memory and strcat the best way to do this?


When I try to print the contents of a readable file (e.g. sifs.h), it prints out the 
contents as well as the bitmap between where each block would end. Not sure why this is 
happening.


Thanks

Hi Chris, I would appreciate some help. When I make a volume using sifs_mkvolume, the

code from here (https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help2002?hl=get%20information&a=802)
to test the header information of my volume and I get the right numbers.
However, when I download the provided volumes from the viewer and try 
to get the header information, I get the correct blocksize but I get nblocks = 0 for 
all of them. I have tried asking a lab tutor but I don't know what could be causing 
these problems.

It just prints void. I'm not sure what to do and I've been stuck on this for days now.

I forgot about the fileIndex in each DIRBLOCK! I'm assuming that we do update the fileblock and the directory, 
but then set the fileindex to that of the filename's position in the fileblock.filenames array.

It is the length (in bytes) of the data pointed to by 'input'.

It is calculated for *any* data,  if you pass it the contents of a file and its length, then 
it'll calculate the MD5 digest of that.

Then you have an error unrelated to MD5.

The file contents store in the volume *is not a string*, so you cannot use string handling 
functions, such as strcat() to copy it.
The file's contents are just a sequence of bytes, of a know length - copy it with memcpy().

The data is not a string, not null-byte terminated, may be 'binary data' (as in a GIF or JPG image, 
and cannot be printed using printf().

You will use anotehr 'blockID + fileindex' paring to represent the new/additional file's location.

Ok, so, the project is due in 2 days and I'm only just starting to code, yes my time 
management is horrible. I have read the project description and watched the lectures 
and workshops and attempted the labs. But I'm having trouble starting the actual 
project.

Could someone please let me know in what order I should attempt the API 
implementations, there's 7 to do and I'm not sure where to start as some may be 
easier/harder than others. 

And any extra tips, advice and information would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers for that, so I should just expect it to print (null) then I'm assuming.

I'm still confused about the first part of my question, as to why I'm getting I'm getting the 
segmentation fault on the fread line:

                        *nbytes = fileblock.length;
                        *data = malloc(*nbytes);
                        fread(data, *nbytes, 1, vol);

I don't believe that memcpy would be useful in this instance, and I'm not sure why this issue is 
occuring..

If you haven't already, you need to write the data to the datablocks (the file contents should then 
appear in the purple boxes on the sifs viewer)

I am struggling to understand what are the entrynames.

Because we create a pointer entrynames of type char, to strdup values into it, we need them 
to be char. However, the variables in entries[MAX_ENTRIES_NAME] within a dir struct are not 
char. The only char are the name of the directory. 

Can someone explain what we do in this file? I have read the link Chris put up but it's not 
helping because lines is a char and I get that it can be strdup into the variable to be 
called.

If you were writing this with variables local to a function, i.e. not parameters that are pointers, 
you'd write:

    nbytes = fileblock.length;
    data   = malloc(bytes);
    //  check if malloc() was successful
    fread(data, nbytes, 1 vol);

Is there a difference in the fread() call?

You can easily test what should (does) happen in such cases by trying them on files and directories 
on your on operating system.  You won't be able to test them as a 'standard' user, but you can if you  
have, say, the files and directories below your own home directory.

Use your own computer, or lab computer, as an experimental tool.

I just did some tests on my computer with basic folders.

so say we have this:  /sub1 -> sub2 -> sub3 -> sub4... and so on

If i say rmdir vol1 /sub1/sub2 do I have to delete sub2,sub3,sub4 and so on. Just thinking with a large volume with 
many connections this would get messy.

Our SIFS_rmdir() is performing the same actions as the standard 'rm' program.

Would the same apply, for a/b/c where b is not actually a directory name but is a file's name. So would it be ENOENT because it's not a valid path, or ENOTDIR because b is not a directory.

Anything below the directory (and the directory itself) is deleted I have read up and 
tested.

so /sub1 will delete sub1 and anything connected to it and the chains of all sub 
directories and files connected in the chain.

So this is right?

To further expound on the previous reply, what you are currently doing is trying to read from 
the start of the file which is wrong because "The header is located at the start of a volume, 
not a directory" - anon.

You should take into account the size of the preceding data (header + bitmap + previous blocks) 
to allocate the offset you need to start at the start of a specific directory.

No, i dont think so. Please test again.

Easy Answer: You can only delete a directory if it does not have children. Read this 
https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19253-01/806-7612/files-20/index.html ... the term you're 
referring to is recursive deletion, but i dont think you need to know that for this project

Dear Chris,

I am having trouble writing the data block into the volume.

Following the discussion here:
https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help2002?p=np&a=1462&all=y11

I can write into the volume with this 

char *cp = (char *)data;
	for (int i=0 ; i < noblocks ; ++i) {
  	char dblock[header.blocksize];
  	memcpy(dblock, cp, sizeof dblock);

	fwrite(dblock, sizeof dblock, 1, vol);
        cp += sizeof(dblock);
}

I have read the contents of the file into the void * data with fread
the file block possesses the correct length of the file. 

fread(data, (int)stat_buffer.st_size*sizeof(char), 1, file);

However, according to this thread: 

https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help2002?p=np&a=1587

it is all internal fragmentation.
what have I done in writing the contents of the file in?

Cheers

No.
Think about it - if multiple 'things', either directories or files or a mix, had the same 
name in the same directory, how would you state which one you wanted to delete or edit?

We can't really tell from what you've provided, but when you execute

     entryname[i]=dirblock.name;

it is not copying the string, as you may hope; it's copying the pointer (not the string's 
content).

If you're later calling    free(entryname[i]);

you'll hit that error with free() because entryname[i] was not dynamically allocated.

strdup() the name.

Perhaps from the upper directory, first run   'make clean'
and then 'make'.

(assuming that you mean that your modified test program does not appear to be any different 
when you execute it).

Hi Matthew, not sure what you mean by "it is all internal fragmentation".

Your code certainly looks like it should work, though observe that the very last block will 
have 'garbage' at its end if the whole file is not a perfect multiple of blocksize.

For example, if your file is 9000 bytes long, and blocksize is 2000 bytes, you'll require 5 
blocks, but only 1000 bytes of the last block will be from your file - the second half of 
the last block will be internal fragmentation, but you can't do anything about that.

A number of tests will require functions in your library to operate with an existing, correct, volume 
and then compare the modified volume or returned results against what was expected.

All students' projects will be testing with the same (starting) volumes and the same testing programs.

The functions which modify a volume are naturally more difficult than those that just read from a 
volume.

However the length of position[0] is 6? How is that possible. I went to print out the array

Please appreciate that no-one can reallyunderstand your question as we have no context of what arrays, 
function, or general approach you're discussing.

To 'force' a string to have a strlen() of 0, you can use:

- strcpy(string, "");
or
- string[0] = '\0';

Sorry, still unable to diagnose the problem even with the help of the image.
We know that you're setting the bitmap correctly, as you have the 3 data-blocks linked to their correct file-
block,  but it still (obviously) looks like you're not writing the file's contents to the correct blocks.

Sorry I can't get the point across without showing the code.

All I am saying is if I have an array called path[] and have a dirname /sub1/sifs_mkvolume.c

When I use strtok() I insert the results into the path array as below:

path[0] =
path[1] = sub1
path[2] = sifs_mkvolume.c

Leaving path[0] empty I want to insert an empty string to represent the root directory name. How can I do this? When I use strcpy() the strlen() of 
path[0] is 6 and the result is not empty but a line of '????'.

A possible issue is that I'm writing this on a Linux machine.

However, could any of these be possible reasons?

Are the datablock's dependant on anything else in the volume? Similar to the file length in the fileblock and the 
assigned bitmap entries (being datablocks already)?

Could it be possible my file "sifs.h" is corrupted? Though I can still open in a text editor?

Is it possible the code is writing in the data at the wrong location? though I'm fairly certian this isn't the 
case.

The data variable is initialized as a void pointer in the calling file, should it be a char pointer? like discussed
previously mentioned thread?

Do you have any suggestions on where to go from here?

It looks like removing the asterisk in front data so that it becomes "data = malloc(*nbytes)" gets rid of the 
segmentation error. I'm also able to print the data (in string format) like so:

> printf("data: %s\n", (char*) data);

But this only works in readfile.c. If I try using the same line of code in sifs_readfile.c it just prints 
(null), so I'm a bit confused whether that's to be expected (since you said I shouldn't be able to print data 
using printf) or whether I've done something wrong. Could you please clarify?

Hi, Matthew, not sure this will help but I've met similar issue before. Maybe try to use a char array with length of blocksize 
to contain the data instead of a pointer? That's what I did and everything works fine.

Submit all of the *.c and *.h files, and the Makefile - just the ones in your library directory - that you have 
written or modified.

Do not submit any files from outside of your library directory.

Using cssubmit, submit each file individually, or archive and submit them in a single zip or tar file.


(I'd appreciate any comment on why what is written on the project's webpage is confusing).

This might be a stupid question but how do you store the data in a char array?

would it look something like this:

fwrite(cp, sizeof cp, 1 ,vol);
(does not compile)

or do you loop through the cp array and assign each element with the corresponding element in the data? 
If so how do you index the data?

cheers for trying to help me out

I am just gonna ask if my approach is correct to completing the defrag function 
I was thinking that i only search through the bitmap, find the unused blocks and 
copy down their position. Then i search through the bitmap for the 
file/data/directory blocks that are next to the unused block's position and then 
simply move them over. 

Is this approach right or am i missing something ?

Just to clarify, there can't be a directory and a file of the same name as each other within a 
directory? I imagined that when performing eg. rmdir pathname, it would distinguish between a 
directory and a file when determining which directory to delete. The same for rmfile, it would only 
delete a file pointed to by the pathname, and ignore a directory of the same name.

Hey Chris,

Regarding the the defrag() function, would it be right to say it accepts only one 
parameter, the volume name?

After moving blocks in the defrag function, should we change the modtime? for example 
moving a directory block causes updates to fileindex in parent directories.

For the writefile function, if given data with zero bytes, should we "write" a 
datablock, or just create a fileblock, or error.

All names are unique within a directory, just like for your OS's file-system.
Try:

{{{
date  >  newfile
mkdir newfile
}}}

or

{{{
mkdir newdirectory
date  >  newdirectory
}}}

(hadn't thought about it, but)
No.  The 'externally visible' entries in the directory haven't changed, just their internal 
storage.

Zero-sized files are OK.
They don't even need a data-block!

I think why it's so confusing is because in order to compile our project it requires sifs.h and the make outside the 
library, and so we think to include that in our submission in order for it to be able to be compiled when tested and 
marked. 

However, I am assuming that you will simply take our library directory with our written .c and .h files and place it 
into a folder with all the sifs.h and files you gave to us already in order for it to compile and you to test them.

You should try the validate this volume then see the description of the red crosses. It is usually

Hi, new person here, but I don't see the need to shift the filenames array. the identity of a specific file 
(not the file block) is its name and the index at which it is stored in the filenames array. If we shift 
the array, it would change all the remaining files' identities. We would then have to change the 
parentblock.entries[fileblockid].fileindex for every other copy of the file we just removed.

Whereas if we left the filenames array as is, if we wanted to add a filename to the array (create another 
copy of the file), we can just iterate through the filenames array until we find the first empty index and 
use that.

You are correct about the fact that shifting will require to also change all the directory block, but if you 
dont shift it ... the problem arises with the index recall of the array (talking about nfiles variable).

Other than that, you do have a great idea about the duplicate file in the first empty index

Im pretty sure there is a definition inside sifs_internal.h about that or somewhere in the 
library.

Another thing to consider is this with md5

I am not sure about the problem, but I believe for strtok. The change of value is caused by 
each iteration of the loop for getting the toekn, you should store that in an array 
somewhere

That is most of it, but you have to note that moving over is not "simple". you have to 
read then rewrite the thing that you move AND ALSO you have to update the positioning 
of the owner of that block

Owner System:
Entry is owned by a directory
Datablock is owned by a fileblock

Thanks for that; good point - added to project sheet.

(the sims.h file was once in the library, with a symbolic link above, but I feared that the link would become broken if some 
students didn't know what it was).

Yes, we'll re-construct the directory structure as provided, with pristine sifs.h and tifs-internal.h files
(we usually need to do this with about 1/4 of submissions, and even extract C code from MS-Word files :-(

It doesn't matter (it doesn't need a meaningful one).
The file length of zero means the firstblockID isn't required.

(discussed several times)
The pathname of "/" refers to the root-directory, and all pathnames (with and without the leading '/') are sought from the root-directory.
Thus, requesting a new directory or new filename of "/" is an error.

Further to Frinze's reply,  an MD5 result is not a string, so strcpy() can't be used.
You'll need memcpy().

I suspect that you're doing something like:

  while(....) {
     names[i] = strtok(pathname, '/');
     ....
  }

and that's why the string pointed to in each names[i] keeps changing during each iteration. ??

try  names[i] = strdup( strtok(pathname, '/') );

The viewer does assume that all file block.nentries are found at the beginning of the filenames[] array;   
assumed the array has no gaps.
But it hasn't really been defined what should happen, as the required name of an empty slot hasn't been 
defined.

As you've described, only one (the former last) filename needs moving, then a scan of all directory 
blocks to find which of their fileindicies need updating.

In sifs_readfile.c  (depending of your definition of 'data')  you may need:

   printf("%s\n", *data);

But keep in mind that file contents are not strings, unless any character in the body of the file happens to be a null-
byte.  Trying to print the contents will likely overrun the provided memory because there's no null-byte.

On the sifs viewer, would this be correct when adding a file with 0bytes?

That is an interesting volume. However,i do believe 
that is an invalif volume due to the fact that 
pathnames are used as a unique identifier. Hence 
name duplicates is an issue.  For example, how 
should fileread,  fileinfo,  rmfile work if there 
is a name duplicate in the same directory??? 
Probably will not behave very well

Hi, Trap 6 error refers to invalid access 
of memory. 

Read more about what's causing it here 
and its behaviour 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41340
717/abort-trap-6-error-in-c

You will find in this reading is that,  
the output "Trap 6" does not appear on 
the line it happens...  So you might want 
to check all those strcpy. Essentially 
what I am trying to say is that the cause 
of trap 6 might not be in the code you 
posted.

Hi Chris, would there be marks awarded if we shifted the filenames array? I ask this as I am still able to fulfil the 
project's functions without shifting the array.

Unsure;  the only likely thing wrong with that small bit of code is if the file-pointer vol 
has already been closed.

Yes, it's normal, they're different "hidden" files that macOS supports with its HFS+ file system.
I think you can have them not included in your Zip archive with:

  ditto -ck --norsrc . destination.zip

So how do you distinguish between a file-entry in use .vs. one not in use?

I understand that you can just loop from 0..MAX_ENTRIES-1 to consider them all,
but how do you know which entries to ignore?

Well, since we know that a file has to be named, if the filename is an empty string, we know that it is not in use. Unless my 
assumption that a file has to be named is wrong.

For each of the entries for a particular 
directory block, if that entry refers to 
another directory block then add the name 
of that child directory block to 
entrynames. If that entry refers to a 
file block then add each of that file 
block's filenames to entrynames.

I looked at the 2018 final exam, and I already have some questions:

For question 5a, when did we go over logical and physical addresses? I remember we 
went over it a bit, but I forgot which lecture/workshop this was discussed.

For question 6, I'm not sure where to go with this one. What I got out of it is that 
removeDirectory uses the other functions to first remove the files from its parent 
directory if it's not empty, and then remove that parent directory? Is this related to 
the 2nd project?

Thanks.

I just wondering if we don’t need to summit the Sif.h ,could  the test system recognize the additional program we wrote for dealing with 
file(like openvolume()).Also since I summited our project 2days ago and just found that we don’t need to summit the sif.h,should we need 
to resubmit again or just leave it there?

Not related to the 2nd project, but exactly aligned with the way your contemporary OS works.

From: chris.mcdonald@uwa.edu.au

In case you've missed the important news:

  https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/air-force-finally-retires-8-inch-floppies-from-missile-launch-control-system/

[Wikipedia reports that the first 8 inch floppies held 80Kbytes of data, but that blew out, over their lifetime, to 175Kbytes, then to 1.2MB]

Five years ago, a CBS 60 Minutes report publicized a bit of technology trivia many in the defense community were aware of: the fact that eight-inch floppy 
disks were still used to store data critical to operating the Air Force's intercontinental ballistic missile command, control, and communications network. 
The system, once called the Strategic Air Command Digital Network (SACDIN), relied on IBM Series/1 computers installed by the Air Force at Minuteman II 
missile sites in the 1960s and 1970s.

Those floppy disks have now been retired. Despite the contention by the Air Force at the time of the 60 Minutes report that the archaic hardware offered a 
cybersecurity advantage, the service has completed an upgrade to what is now known as the Strategic Automated Command and Control System (SACCS), as 
Defense News reports. SAACS is an upgrade that swaps the floppy disk system for what Lt. Col. Jason Rossi, commander of the Air Force’s 595th Strategic 
Communications Squadron, described as a “highly secure solid state digital storage solution.” The floppy drives were fully retired in June.

Found it hiding on my laptop, and is now added to

  http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/lectures/lecture21/05.html

Keep in mind that it was just a 'throw-away' program to demonstrate that the simple greyscale 
formula works;  it doesn't use the RGBCOLOUR datatype, but you could easily modify it.

Those, or similar, exam questions are suitable/possible for this year's exam.

The topics of reading directories, determining what is in a directory, and examining some basic attributes of 
a directory entry were discussed in Lecture 17.  The sample code in that lecture came from executable 
examples, so you can cut-and-paste the examples, add a main() function, and try them.

As discussed on Tuesday, it's not essential to get the names of functions, macros, and structure members 
exactly correct  (just like in your question :-)  but you should try to use something 'close' that indicates 
you have an understanding of the question and how it can be solved.

You'll find out on the day,
though it will be 3:3, 4:2, or 3.5:2.5.
However, I feel that it's unwise to organise your study around any particular ratio.

Hi Chris,
In previous years (I believe) there has been scaling to move the cohort average, my 
understanding is that this is now gone. Since this had been taken away has the average 
dropped at all? Because looking at the averages from the previous exams and it seems the 
final exam is quite difficult. 
So I'm just wondering if this unit previously received any scaling and is there any 
moderation is marks anymore or are our final marks just the addition of all our raw 
weighted marks?
I understand that it doesn't really matter in the context of things as we are all on the 
same playing field so too speak but despite that I'm still curious.
Cheers

Prior to the beginning of this year different Faculties and departments were permitted to apply 
their own scaling policies (formulaic adjustment of final marks) in an effort to make each unit's 
marks meet some criteria.  Units within our Faculty were required to adjust marks so that they 
fell within a range, while other Schools required their units to have a certain average mark.

In 2017 CITS2002 final exam marks were scaled upwards by 6% to meet this requirement. In 2018 it 
was messy because a number of students did not attempt the single project, did not withdraw, then 
attended the final exam and did very poorly ('wrecking' any sensible unit average); the marks of 
those attempting all assessment components were eventually adjusted.

 From 2019 all scaling schemes across campus have been removed,  a good thing because students 
taking units in different Faculties had been subject to different policies.  So, you're correct, 
no scaling in this, or any other, unit.

 From the new University Assessment Policy it's now:

"criterion-referenced assessment - is designed to provide a measure of students' performance that 
is directly relevant to the learning outcomes and not determined in relation to the performance of 
other students, nor in relation to predetermined distribution of grades/marks. This approach to 
assessment provides an indication of the specific knowledge and skills each student can 
demonstrate through an assessment task."

If you're asking for the exam, then it won't matter.

Otherwie, I can't really say;  I don't use either of those functions because I often need to 
tokenize constant strings, which they can't do.  I often just use sscanf() or a pair of functions 
of my own, that I use like this:

{{{
int    ntokens;
char **tokens = tokenize( string, &ntokens, separators );

for(int t=0 ; t < ntokens ; ++t) {
    printf("%s\n", tokens[t]);
}
free_tokens( tokens );
}}}

Hi Chris,

I reviewing lecture 19 and the last slide I am confused how the last part of the code 
works: 

    argc  -= optind;
    argv  += optind;

I know that optind is apart of the unistd library, however, why are we subtracting the 
count and adding the argv? Because before this code is reached, the while loop is 
complete with all flags initialised respectively. I just don't understand what this 
part is doing with the command line.

Thanks.

Just to add to Chris' comment (and from my perspective as a student who has both taken this unit, and marked previous years exams); as you have (hopefully) found during the projects, the systems 'theory' part of this unit is often exposed within the 'coding' part of the unit. As a result, I like to advocate ~20% (arbitrary, but in my opinion a reasonable amount) of study time to how the 'theory' relates to the 'coding', and vice versa. 

Additionally, do not fear the coding parts of the exam! 
This component is easily practiced, too; go through labsheets 2-5, take 10-15 minutes per question, and see if you can handwrite some code without looking at *any* resources. Then, compare with your solution or Chris' solution, and look out for all the obvious things you missed. 

Good luck!

Life's a lot easier if the array elements you want are at the front of that array.
So you either modify the array to 'discard' the already used/seen elements, or you can change your 
view of the array.

For example,  if a program is invoked as:

   program -s -x cat dog horse

then, initially in main(), argc is 6 and argv points to "program".

Once getopt() has done its work, we no longer care about the consumed arguments, so we can 
increment argv by 3, making it point to "cat", and decrement argc by 3 because we've skipped over 
3 arguments.

getopt() is responsible for determining the value of optind = 3.

Yes, but there's an even simpler (coding) solution (but one which might have a computational downside in certain cases).

Thanks, That makes it a bit clearer. So after the consumed arguments, we are essentially putting the 
pointer from the end of the vector (after horse) of the strings, back to a position where we can go 
over the arguments?

So if we have for example:

./program -x cat -y dog -z horse

How would this differ? Or will it not?

Thanks.

No;  getopt() is only looking for options beginning with '-'.
My previous example was always counting from the beginning, with argv[0] = "program".


> So if we have for example:
> 
> ./program -x cat -y dog -z horse

If you're going to permit options and non-options to be mixed like that, then coding becomes very messy, and 
you need to be aware of what platform you're using.  Consider the program:

{{{
#include < stdio.h>
#include < getopt.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    printf("before calling getopt():\n\t");
    for(int a=0 ; a < argc ; ++a) {
        printf(" %s", argv[a]);
    }
    printf("\n");
    while(getopt(argc, argv, "xyz") != -1) {  
        ;
    }
    printf("after calling getopt():\n\t");
    for(int a=0 ; a < argc ; ++a) {
        printf(" %s", argv[a]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    printf("optind = %i\n", optind);
    return 0;
}
}}}

Running:

  ./program -x cat -y dog -z horse

on an up-to-date macOS machine will print:

    before calling getopt():
	     ./program -x cat -y dog -z horse
    after calling getopt():
	     ./program -x cat -y dog -z horse
    optind = 2

while running the same on an up-to-date Linux machine will print:

    before calling getopt():
	     ./program -x cat -y dog -z horse
    after calling getopt():
	     ./program -x -y -z cat horse dog
    optind = 4

____
Each depends on which library/implementation of the function getopt() you're using.
The best thing about standards is that there's so many to choose from.

You're allocating space for your vector of words, but not for each individual word.
Was expecting to see a strdup() in there somewhere.

(Also, do not typecast the return result of your function).

Thanks, I changed that line to:

uniqueWords[uniqueWordsIndex] = strdup(currentWord);

And now it works. However, it returns a lot more unique words than I expect. If I attempt to 
read a text file with this content: "this is a test file", the file apparently contains 22 
unique words. These words are as follows:

this
is
a
test
file
x
h
p
X
e
N
o
K
f
d
w
C
F
P
H
M
D

The first five are definitely in the text file but I'm not sure where the other 17 are coming 
from.

        }
        *nwords = num_words;
        return list;
}

Don't know why, but it seems like the while loop keeps repeating over and over again.

So I was doing these questions. 

For Q1 i used the tm.tm_wday, tm.tm_mon etc. Is this the way to do it or effectively 
allowed using time_t and such with structures?

For Q6 Again do we assume a file is a structure like the project and called the 
modified variable inside the structure to check if its within the "since" parameter 
variable?

Thanks.

It's off to a good start, but the termination condition for your while loop appears unrelated to 
what's happening inside the loop.  Ensure that any such loop you write will be bounded, and if you 
have fork() in your loop, be doubly sure - or exponentially sure - that it will terminate.  And the 
parent process needs to wait for the child to finish....

It's just a simple "programming problem";  you don't really need help from a library or system 
call.

No, unrelated to our 2nd project.
This time you will need a number of systmm calls in your solution.

This is the first year that scaling won't be allowed, so does that mean the exam will be 
easier? If the exam's the same difficulty as in previous years (i.e. ~50% average) that

Hi Chris,

I was just wondering if we will be required the specifics of how to actually write a

these patterns and variables, and generally just copy and modify existing

No, I don't believe that the exam is any easier than in past years.

And I don't know on what basis you're suggesting that past average marks have been 50% - if you're 
seeing that the 'average' in 2018 was 32/60 and in 2017 was 33/60, then you're seeing figures that 
include students who were absent from the final exam (without withdrawing), those who attended the 
final exam and wrote nothing, and those who scored, say, less than 15/60  (where would you like to 
draw that line such that you still consider those students to have been making an honest attempt?)

If three students attend the final exam, and earn 50/60, 40, and 0, what should their average be?

Exams are set to provide good coverage of a unit's material, and to a certain degree of difficulty 
(though it's certainly an inexact science);  they are not set knowing that the marks will scaled to 
meet some long irrelevant range, and students should not be fine-tuning their study with the hope 
that overall marks will be scaled.  Moreover, any individual student's result in an exam, and 
overall, is now the result of that student's knowledge and effort, not based on the performance of 
any other students in the unit.

Hi;  yes, a viable exam topic.
Like C coding questions you wouldn't be assessed on fine-grain syntax, but if you have a general 
understanding of how make works, then you can certainly write a reasonable Makefile.

In lecture 17, the final slide. I am trying to pretty much replicate the code, however 
it always errors at the valid path if statement.

if(stat(fullpath,pointer) !=0)

I was wondering what is the way to write a pathname into an argument? For example

./foo Cits2002

./foo Desktop/Cits2002

These don't seem to work. What is the correct way to write a pathname?

Can you better explain 'errors'  (not traditionally used as a verb)?

Both of those examples use valid (relative) pathnames;  replace ./foo by ls to ensure that they 
exist.

They do exist. For example if I do this:
$ls java

this file contents are:
BlueJ 4.2.0
CITS1001

So if I try to call ./foo Java it doesn't get pass the line of code if(stat(fullpath,pointer) !=0)

OK, it's still unclear what you mean by "doesn't get past".
Does the function return zero or non-zero,  and where does execution go?
We cannot tell from a single line.

	}

	closedir(dir);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	list_directory(argv[1]);

In your code, dirname is a pointer - just 8 bytes long.

How do we get the length of the dirname? Even if I set it to 50/100/1000 characters 
the same problem is happening

Have you yet investigated the difference between sizeof() and the
standard function strlen() - seen and used many times in our lectures,
and laboratory and project work?

I suggest that you take a break from it.

Into your array, exactly long enough to hold the characters of 'dirname' (but not the null-
byte), you're trying to format and fit in all of:

  sprintf(fullpath," %s/%s", dirname, dp->d_name);

Look at  Lecture 17, p11.

Yes, about 7 (don't have the marking sheet in front of me).
It won't quite work as you need to read the directory entries more than once (for your while loop) and need to 
format the fullpath of each entry before calling stat().

See today's other glorious thread on   dir attributes.

Ah, I think I see my errors, pretty much as soon as I posted the thread, I realised I didn't continue reading the directory names (Should've proof read, bad practice on my end)

for my stat() call, should it be stat(de->d_name, pointer)? Would this fix my problem?

I'm not sure what you mean by this? The Sprintf() code is exactly as the lecture. The only 
difference with the code is the lecture uses MAXPATHLEN. 

I have practically copied the code on the lecture to see if I can run it and change things for 
different types of possible questions.

When I print the fullpath, it is "Java/." which doesn't make sense to me. Shouldn't it be 
"./Java"

Sorry if I am missing something very simple, it's just I can't seem to see it or comprehend 
what is going on.

It might be because of your fullpath array's size @ its declaration, try char fullpathname[sizeof(*dirname)]

I don't understand if I set fullpath[20] then use sprintf() why something as small as Java/. cannot be copied into it. Some people are suing malloc but not sure where to use malloc here and 
why this wasn't used in the lectures.

You're probably requiring more than just 20 bytes.
For example, "Java/project1.class" requires 21 bytes to store it.

The system-provided constant MAXPATHLEN is 1024, and is defined/provided because it's the maximum possible length of *any* pathname.
And in <sys/errno.h> we also have     #define ENAMETOOLONG    63    /* File name too long */

You're using a new definition of 'exactly'.

I see people have been using the header <sys/stat.h> for this question. I'm not 100% 
sure on what it does though e.g. what do we use 'struct stat' for, why do we sometimes 
assign it as a pointer, and what does 'stat()' do exactly?

The most useful long-term answer is to ask what you have already found out - from the lecture 
material, an online manual, tutorial, or book?  What have you read about stat() that is unclear?

So far I'm under the impression that struct stat stores the status of a file or directory it can be assigned to by 
using stat? Say I had this portion of code in my function:

...
DIR *dir;
dir = opendir(directoryfilename);
struct stat *directory;
while(directory->readdir(dir) != NULL){
       struct stat buffer;
       struct stat *pointer = &buffer;
       if(S_ISDIR(pointer->d_name){
...

Since we're reading from an existing directory, what does struct stat *pointer do here? Does it do anything at all?

Hi Chris,

In the exam will we be penalized if we do not include the #include statements when 
writing our code? 
E.g. We want to use stat, do we have to write #include <sys/stat.h> ?

You may call the stat() system call to request that the kernel 'fills in' the fields of the structure for a named item.

In this context, orthogonal means distinct or independent of all other (functions).
For example, the OS provides only one-way to perform a particular task - one way to open a file, one way to remove a file,...

There are common exceptions to this - see  man 2 stat  for example.
We're in a transition between 32-bit and only 64-bit kernels so, for a few years yet, there appear to be duplicate functions,
but each just has a different set of parameter datatypes or return value.

We also saw this when the largest file possible was 2^32 bits;  then along came DVDs requiring bigger file sizes.

[In 3-D geometry we'd describe the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis as orthogonal to each other,
and talk of orthogonal basis functions in higher dimensions]

You do not lose marks for not doing something.
You earn marks for doing/providing/stating something correctly.

I suggest that you want the very last lecture, where I stated that you would receive marks for 
providing (relevant) system header files.

So to say a language is not orthogonal would be to say that there are multiple ways of achieving the same result? Wouldn't that imply that C weren't orthogonal as core functionality can be achieved in different ways? For example:

{{{
 for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    printf("%i\n", i); 
}
// is equivalent to 
int x = 0;
while(x < 10) {
    printf("%i\n", x);
    x++;
}

}}}

I'm not familiar with whole programming languages being described as orthogonal and, yes, I reckon all programming languages with have at least two overlapping forms of control flow
(there's something in my rusty brain suggesting that Turing complete languages, by their nature, must have this, but don't even look it up).

It makes much more sense to just speak of a set of functions, such as a set of system-calls, as being orthogonal.

Hi Chris,

I would like some clarification on this question:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Consider a 2-dimensional spreadsheet − a rectangular grid of cells, each of which 
holds an
arbitrary string of characters, or an empty string if the value of the cell has not 
yet been
defined. Each cell is identified by 2 non-negative integer values, identifying a 
specific row
and column.

Define a C99 user-defined data type to represent an instance of the 2-dimensional 
spreadsheet.

Next, define and implement three C99 functions:
• one to return a pointer to allocated memory suitable for storing and managing the
spreadsheet,
• one to swap the contents of two indicated columns in a spreadsheet, and
• one to completely deallocate all memory allocated to a spreadsheet

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the first function that we need to implement, what does "managing" refer to? 
Are we just required to allocate a single instance of a spreadsheet and return a 
pointer to it, or is the function also supposed to re-size a spreadsheet (even make 
it smaller?)

	char *sentence;	

	sentence = strtok(chapter, ".");	
	while(sentence != NULL){
	   if( (array = realloc(array, sizeof(array) + sizeof(*sentence) + 1) ==NULL){
			return NULL;
	   }
	   strcpy(array[nsentences], *sentence);		
	   sentence = strtok(NULL, ".");
	}
}



Im just not to sure if I have the right idea on how to use realloc

I may be wrong here, but your if statement for checking the mod times for filesm shouldn't it be:

if(file->st_mtime >= since)

because its checking to see if a file has been modified SINCE that time??

That first function doesn't have to do the work of storing and resizing.
It only need to 'do enough' that a future (unwritten) function could do all the work.

There was no mention of making a spreadsheet smaller, other than completely deallocating it.

No. You're confusing the role of sizeof() and strlen() (which you haven't used).

You can use realloc() to grow/extend arrays, as you're trying to do, but the starting value of any 
pointers needs an initial value.

And while you're trying to grow the array of sentences, you're then incorrectly trying to copy 
each sentence into space that hasn't been allocated (and doesn't exist).

___
If you're chasing an accurate solution, the obvious question is - have you tried it to see if it 
works?

It's very close.

As with other similar attempts by other students, you'll need to format the directory and entry names before 
you call stat().

Check what you do with the 'returned sum of bytes' on failed recursive calls.

And the following suggestion about checking the _mtime is correct.



> Wasn't sure if the parent directory portion was necessary.

Unsure what you mean by this.

This will be my last question regarding this topic. I have created a control flow after the while loop header like so:

if (strcmp(dp->d_name, ".") == 0) || strcmp(dp->d_name,"..") == 0)
{
    continue;
}

So for a file on my Desktop. It is called Finance. So I implement the arguments like so:

./foo Finance

Then it gives me the entries like so:

Finance/.
Finance/..
FinanceFINA1221
Error! (here is when I call stat(fullpath,pointer) != 0)

Any reason why this may be happening?

I have a good idea how to do this coding it, but just need some clarifications on the 
description.

When it says "true" word after punctuation and whitespace is removed. So if I have a 
word called "don't" does that mean we remove the ' so it would be "dont"? Also what is 
the purpose of removing whitespace in a text? 

E.g.

"Hi name name is". When will whitesapce affect the true word in the text? Bit confused 
by this.

Thanks.

Hi Chris,

I'm a bit confused about one of your slides on partitions, where it says:

Equal sized partitions introduce two problems:

    a process's requirements may exceed the partition size, and

    a small process still occupies a full partition. Such wastage of memory is termed internal memory fragmentation. 

The initial choice of partition - the placement algorithm - is, of course, trivial with equal-sized partitions.

 

Unequal sized partitions offer obvious advantages with respect to these problems, but they complicate the placement algorithm. Either:

    a process is placed in the largest (large-enough) partition, to minimise internal memory fragmentation, or

    a process is placed in the smallest (large-enough) available partition. 

The initial placement algorithm is again simple, but also introduces excessive internal memory fragmentation.


Maybe I'm misunderstanding the concept, but wouldn't placing a process in the "largest(large-enough) partition" actually maximise internal fragmentation, rather than minimise it? In that case, it seems like placing a process in the smallest (large enough) available partition is the only reasonable algorithm to choose. 

Also, you emphasised "available" with italics in the second option and did not use the word at all in the first. Is that an intentional distinction, as in the first algorithm involves adding a new process to the largest (large enough) partition, regardless of whether it's currently occupied? I wouldn't have thought that was sensible, unless we're talking about virtual memory. I'm really just not understanding those last two points in general.

Thanks,
Jordan

I believe in unequal size partitioning, if you place a process in the smallest (large-enough) partition, then you are in effect making the remaining space even "smaller" 
and it would be unlikely that you would find another process small enough to fit into that gap. Whereas if you assign it to the largest (large-enough) partition, then
you are more likely to fill the remaining space with another processes, thereby reducing internal fragmentation. There is a tradeoff, as this reduces the size of the largest
 available partition, and so it would increase the likelihood of external fragmentation.

I'm trying to free an array of strings as so:


for (int i = 0; i < arrLen; i++) {
	printf("freeing %s\n", arr[i]);
	free(arr[i]);
	printf("freed %s\n", arr[i]);
}
free(arr);

// Code below is for testing
for (int i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
	printf("if this shows up then it wasn't freed? %s\n", argv[i]);
}

This code seems to run without crashing, but this is not what I'd expect as the line 
"printf("freed %s\n", arr[i]);" works fine and prints the (supposedly freed) value of 
arr[i]. The same thing occurs for the for loop after "free(arr);".

I'm not sure whether the memory has actually been freed or not. Have I done something 
wrong?

I wrote some code to go through a string array of unknown size and print each string in the 
array.

void goThroughStringArray(char **strings) {
	while (strings != NULL) {
		printf("%s\n", *strings);
		strings++;
	}
}

This is the code I use to test:

char** strings = malloc(5 * 100);
strings[0] = strdup("test1");
strings[1] = strdup("test2");
strings[2] = strdup("test3");
strings[3] = NULL;
goThroughStringArray(strings);

What ends up happening is that test1, test2, and test3 are printed, but then after that "
(null)" is printed several times until I encounter a segmentation fault. This confuses me 
as I included a condition to check whether strings points to a NULL pointer, so I'm 
confused as to why this occuring.

Would anyone be able to point me in the right direction?

Correction, what I was saying only applies memory allocation algorithms for dynamic partitioning. I think you can only fit one process into a partition in variable-size fixed partitioning.

A good point;  when written I was probably only thinking about end of word, end of sentence 
punctuation, and not the apostrophe.

No-one has previously asked this question (and I'm not dismissing it), but appreciate that this 
question is focused of your understanding of dynamic memory allocation and storage, and not on 
precise parsing or tokenization of the input text.

So if you stored the word   don't   as   don't   or even as   don  and  t
if would not affect how your answer was marked.

It's a good question, whose answer depends on what we believe/think that 'being freed' means.

When a process calls free() it indicates to the library managing the dynamic memory allocation (the 
functions malloc, calloc, realloc, and free) that the program no longer wishes to use that memory, that 
the value stored in the just freed memory is no longer important to the process.

Once freed, the memory may be re-allocated by the library of functions at any (future) time if the 
process requests more memory.  Freeing memory does not result in it being 'destroyed' somehow, or in 
it being written/overwritten with any special value.

In your first piece of code, when you call free(), that's it, it's been freed, you've indicated that 
you no longer require that memory.

It is wrong to attempt to use, to rely upon, that freed memory after you free it - it is wrong to try 
to read/write/print that memory because it may have already been re-allocated for another purpose.

Imagine you're writing a program with a multi-threaded GUI.
In your code above, imagine that 'between' your statement to free() memory, and to then printf() its 
value, someone wiggles the mouse or clicks a button in your program's GUI, and the code handling 
that mouse action calls malloc().  The library is permitted to re-use your previously freed memory 
because you've 'promised' that you will no longer require it.

In your code you're able to print the freed memory simply because the memory hasn't yet been re-allocated.
Consider:

  free(p);
  x = malloc(10);
  *x = 'a'
  *p = 'b';

The above code may have just written the character 'b' into memory pointed to by x.

The value of 'string' can *never* be NULL  (unless it was initially NULL).
For any non-NULL value of 'strings' initially passed to the function, each iteration of your while loop 
will simple add 8 (= sizeof( char ** ) ) to 'strings'.

What may possibly/eventually be NULL, is what 'strings' points to, so:

    while(*strings != NULL) {

The marking of your 2nd projects is progressing, but I can't yet give a definitive date as to 
when we'll finish.  A total of 191 projects were submitted, 109 of these by pairs of students. 
35 submissions included functions to defragment the volumes.

It's notable how many different ways that students have written (and submitted) their 
projects, far more ways than anticipated.  In the olden days, many more students attended 
laboratory times, and their projects were more heavily influenced by laboratory demonstrators 
who offered similar advice to all students.  With so many more students now undertaking their 
projects without this common advice, there's a far wider variety of approaches, taking longer 
to understand.

___
If you're interested in reading a sample solution to the project, you may download one from:

  http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/projects/sifs-sample.zip

Remember that you were only required to develop and submit functions in the library, but the 
sample solution also includes simple (almost identical) application programs that each call 
one of the library functions.

Like most submissions, the sample solution has identified that a number of identical or very 
similar code/functions are common across all of the required functions, and these have been 
declared in library/additions.h, defined in library/additions.c, and the file library/Makefile 
modified so that all required functions depend on these additional functions.

With reference to your exam on Monday, it would be a good investment of your time to look over 
the *comments* in the sample solution, but not to deeply study the sample's source code.

Good luck,

Thanks; that's certainly a fair comment.

There's a lot of things we have to balance - whatever lab sessions are run, we need to employ people to help 
in the labs.  The number of potential (qualified and interested) laboratory demonstrators is quite limited, 
if on a postgraduate scholarship the demonstrators are limited in how many hours per week they can work, they 
have their own study and life commitments, and there's a finite and fixed budget for each unit to cover 
laboratory demonstrating and marking.

We also have a situation, which has emerged over recent years, that far fewer students choose to come to 
campus regularly (for their own many reasons), so we limit the number of laboratory sessions that we run each 
week.  Some sessions are practically empty in some weeks, even when there's a labsheet to do, and most are 
packed near project deadlines.  If labs were always near capacity, we'd have about 16 x 2hr labs per week, 
instead of the more 'open' arrangement of 9 labs that we have,  but you'd have to use your allocated 2 hour 
lab session, and not be permitted to attend any other session.

I agree, it stinks.
Write to your Minister for Parliament, complain, and state you'd like to pay more HECS or higher 
international fees, provided that it trickles down to the teaching areas.

You cannot.
You'll need to use an additional variable to remember/save the pointer's starting location,  just 
like in these lab solutions for strcat():

There's no "However" about it.
It can all be solved with any necessary number of additional variables to hold copies of 'starting' pointers, and the 
correct combination of loops.

Hi Chris,

I was just wondering. Will the programming questions be based on the lab work we have

some of the stuff like bitwise, self-referential, forking etc. we haven't learnt to

Hi, why do you continue over entries that are named '.' and '..'? And what does it mean to format the names before calling 
stat()? They need to be null-terminated?

The . and .. are current directory and parent directory respectfully. They don't contain the entries necessary to check. For 
example if we don't continue your formatting will look like this:

foo/.
foo/..
foo/file.txt
foo/directory

Therefore if we continue over them, using the stat() and checking if its a file or dir becomes much easier without much hassle 
with errors.

Regarding formatting:
The dirname is for the example above "foo", and dp->d_name is "file.txt". So we need to format it so its a full path like this 
"foo/file.txt", which helps when using the control flows. Otherwise it will look like this "foofile.txt", which makes no sense.

Hope this helps.

Yes, more correct, but - 'array' is never initialised, check the way you increment 
nsentences, you're confusing the role of sizeof() and strlen(), and as suggested strdup() 
would be a better choice to allocate memory and copy each sentence.

Difficult to give advice that's correct in all instances.
But consider Q6 of 2018 - the students hadn't previously seen the system calls unlink() or 
rmdir() before in labs or projects,  but there's a sufficient description of both in the question 
to produce an answer receiving full marks.

So we use our knowledge from the lab work and just expand on them, which you will provide sufficient

Yes; an effective exam can ask you to perform at all but the highest levels of Bloom's Taxonomy  (leave the 
highest level for an essay, dissertation, or thesis).
Rote learning is waaaay down the bottom, while synthesis (as you've described) is much more valued.

For the structure we are required to make in 2, can we just make the array a double pointer? Instead of a triple? So its Just a array of pointers that point to strings?

    //IF FALSE, TRY NEXT COMBINATION 'NEEDLE STRING LENGTH' OF HAYSTACK
    //IF ALL COMBINATIONS HAVE BEEN TESTED AND NONE RETURN TRUE, THEN RETURN FALSE
    
    int hayLength = strlen(haystack);
    int needleLength = strlen(needle);
    int target = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < (hayLength - needleLength) + 1; i++)
    {
        target = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < needleLength; j++)
        {
            if (haystack[i+j] == needle[j])
            {
                target++;

Hi Chris, 

I don't think this was asked in the last lecture but will we have to do any parameter 
checking in our solutions in the exam? For example with the needle in the haystack 
question would it be necessary to check if the length of the needle is shorter than 
the haystack (and consequently return false to indicate an error)?

Hi there,

In the context of traversing a string for example, what would this do exactly -> I 
know it works and it makes sense in my head but I don't know how to word it 
theoretically.

while loop (with some condition){
*variable++ = *othervariable++; 
}
And in what other contexts would you do this? 

Sorry if this is a silly question its late and I cant seem to think.

Thanks!

Quite a possible exam question/topic, but you wouldn't be asked to just write the code for, say, a stack or a list, but would 
be expected to use it to write a short function, or to solve a 'problem'.

Yes, the approach can get full marks;
you may like to call strlen() of each parameter only once, by moving the two integer definitions 
earlier in your function.

Accounting for a leap year makes a more correct solution.

The body of the loop "copies the data (you haven't indicated what the datatypes are) currently 
pointed to by othervariable, to the location currently pointed to by variable, and then 
advances both pointers to each point to their next contiguous data item".


> And in what other contexts would you do this?

If your goal was to write easy-to-read code that will be maintained by someone else in the 
future (or even if working with a project partner in a unit), you *wouldn't* write this.
It would be far better (easier to read and quicker to understand) to write the single 
assignment statement as three statements: one assignment, and two pointer increments.

Hello,

With regards to theory questions I am wondering how much is sufficient to attain full

Q: " Explain clearly the difference between a program and a process. What are the 
important pieces of information that a multi-processing operating system needs to 
save during process switching? "

Program: a sequence of written instructions
Process: an executable instance of a program
A program is a passive entity whilst a process is an active entity.

Important info:
- States: running, ready, new, exit, blocked and suspended
- Time quantum: how long is a process running/how long is it blocked
- Information of files opened by the process - permissions etc
- Process ID and Parent ID
- Current working directory

Thanks!

The above line looks very strange.
You're starting (in English) with an empty data-structure (no location, no size), so just 
initialise listOfWords to NULL.

Moreover, you don't know, or have, any starting value for nwords - it's a value that the 
function will need to calculate and manage itself - so its (unknown) value can't be used to 
indicate the size of any data.



>             char **temp = realloc(listOfWords, *nwords * sizeof(char[*nwords]
> [MAX_WORD_SIZE]));

Similarly, you'll want to re-think this use of realloc for a data-structure that started out 
'empty', and is then added to one element at a time.

These questions are marked the same way as the coding questions - this question is worth 5 marks, 
so the marking key has about 8-10 relevant points/concepts that you could discuss.  It's quite 
possible to earn full marks, 5 for this question, as soon as you've introduced and discussed just 
5 points.  But, as some security, if you know more than 5 that are correct, write them too.

(advice: don't write 'etc' in any formal writing, or for an exam answer - it's read as "there are 
other important things but I can't remember them").

function and use it with input from a text.

Also, bitwise lecture. Would you require us to show for example using bitwise operations on how to determine a file or make a 
certain colour using RGB.

Thanks.

In that case, it seems like placing a process in the smallest (large enough) available partition is the only reasonable algorithm to choose. 

As far as I'm aware you're right here. Chris may have possibly intended for it to read external fragmentation. As you said placing processes in the largest available partition that can contain them will result in large amounts of memory wastage.

It would make sense for it to mean external fragmentation here as maintaining large partitions of memory would mean that when the smaller process is swapped out or is released that a large partition of contiguous memory is available for larger processes, however, this is obviously at the expense of increased internal memory fragmentation. 



> Also, you emphasised "available" with italics in the second option and did not use the word at all in the first. Is that an intentional distinction, as in the first algorithm involves adding a new process to the largest (large enough) partition, regardless of whether it's currently occupied? I wouldn't have thought that was sensible, unless we're talking about virtual memory. I'm really just not understanding those last two points in general.

I think the emphasis is to just drive the point home that it's available, I don't think Chris is implying that the first placement algorithm selects any partition regardless of whether it is in use, this would cause a lot of crashes as running processes would have their memory overwritten.

It is also worth remembering that at this point in the lecture Chris hadn't yet introduced paging, so there's no implication that the largest memory partition would simply be paged out to make way for the new process.

I have few questions regarding question 6. For the rmdir() and unlink() functions, do 
they require the full path name. If we didn't put in the full path name, would there be a 
penalty for that?

Below is my code for the question. I do not know how to get back 'up' the directories but 
if I submitted this answer, roughly what mark would I get?

Also, is there a way to go back 'up' in the directories (e.g. opendir(".")).

Thank You

I've received emails and heard many comments (on the full spectrum from
'challenging' to 'impossible') that the manychessmoves question was a
life-affirming moment for a number of students,  and I'm interested to
find out why.

??

For your interest (which, I appreciate will have wained) there's a
solution to the problem below,  with the comments for the markers as
to where they can look for marks in your solutions.  The question was
worth 10 marks, but there's 16 marks identified in this solution.

Of course there'll be other ways to solve it, too,  but the general
approach is to just keep, say, 4 copies of the same programming running
until any of them fails, or until we've completed the required total
number.

Other than the system calls required, and given in the question - fork(),
execs(), and wait(), all called in the standard way - most of the solution
required some standard header files, checking function arguments, and
loops controlled by integer variables.

Yes, a problem that you hadn't seen before (and won't be in the Deferred
exam), but I don't believe anything as extreme as the comments about it.

On the topic of the exam, question 3 and 4 were talking about writing programs. A program 
consists of a main function, so if we wrote a main function and called the required function 
would that have been awarded any marks? 
I know from the lectures we were supposed to just write functions but the use of the word 
"program" to me (and I'm sure many others) sounded like a main function was needed.

To put in my $0.02 I would say that the question probably included a lot
of information and terms that many students hadn't seen before. The notion
that a process can be parallelised (something that is addressed fully in
later units), though tangentially mentioned when discussing CPU scheduling
may have coloured people's understanding of what to do. Similarly, the
idea of running heuristic algorithms that produce different outputs each
time might be a little spooky for people that haven't done AAAI. That
said I think it was a decent question and will probably prove to be a good
mark differentiator between distinction and high distinction students.

The premise that if we have the basic tools to undertake a problem, it should be easily 
doable, is flawed. High school students are taught the basics of complex numbers and 
calculus. Expecting them to be able to do something like complex analysis, is unrealistic. 
Although functions such as fork(), execs(), and wait() have been shown in a few lecture 
slides, using them in a completely different context, is difficult. Questions similar to 
this, have only appeared in past exams (without solutions). There has been no practical 
applications of these concepts, other then writing a solution to an exam question, and 
hoping it is correct. The lack of exposure to, and application of these concepts, paired 
with using them in a completely new context, made for a very challenging question. Not 
everyone is good at abstracting concepts to a new context, especially with the added timed 
pressure of an exam. The question was definitely not impossible, but to people without 
familiarity to this new context. It might as well have been impossible

It is however a necessary skill for computer scientists. In many situations as a programmer you are not going to possess a complete understanding of the domain in which you are working and so an ability to abstract away unnecessary detail is essential. Probably not on the unit outline but a useful thing for people to be made aware of.

Yes, the question did ask for a program, so you'll have received a mark if you provided one (just one, 
becuase the main function has nothing significant to do in this problem).  I've updated the sample code, 
above.

Thanks for your reply Eddie.

Talking with a couple of students yesterday, they stated that their discomfort arose from a 
question with a 'wall of text' to read. This may be something distinguishing STEM exam 
questions, from those in the Humanities (often read an esaay, then write an essay), but 
something students are likely to see more of in 3rd year.

I'm unsure if the word or idea of a heuristic is a difficult concept,  even if not-yet-studied 
by students half way through a computing degree  (but glad that I changed it from 'non-
deterministic algorithm').  I'm confident that many students see heuristic approaches 'every 
day' when playing a game against a computer opponent, but may not have thought about it much.

Thanks for your reply.
I don't agree with your analogy at all. Firstly, we're a long way from high school, and this question 
was not tackling anything as distant (to high school students) as calculus.  It was certainly an unseen 
question (and, yes, under exam time pressure), but it 'only' required an application of concepts seen 
in the unit, and some problem solving.  I'm not seeing what you're describing as a 'new context', 
unless it's that a parent process can simultaneously have multiple child processes running (just like 
your shell, and compiler, do)

I'd met with about 30 students the week before the exam who, until that time, were employing the study 
of (many, rote learning) past exam papers as their sole means of study,  often asking if a particular 
question was likely to appear again. Yes, they'd refer to lecture material to find where 'the answer 
was covered', hoping it was on just a few contiguous pages, and not across multiple lectures.  None had 
ever cut-and-paste the code presented in a lecture (in the grey boxes), turned it into a program, 
compiled and run it.  Similarly, a number of students had emailed me (using a computer) their attempts at
past exam questions asking "if it would work".  Using a computer.  Somehow we need to get across a
stronger message about exam preparation (and project submission, another story).

I'm unsure of the origins of the wide-held belief that exams should only examine previously seen ideas
(previous technical concepts, yes, but not the application of those concepts in different areas).
It may be a survival technique as fewer full-time students study full-time.

I do not see why there is always someone that comes on the help forum to try and defend the questions.

Yes the questions asked usually have a purpose, but there is no reason why students shouldn't be able to critique them.

The issue being raised was that it was not a topic covered substantially enough to validate it being included in such an exam question.

That's all.

I wholeheartedly disagree with this analogy as well. You're using a similar example to draw parallels but taking it way too 
much to the extreme. Complex analysis is a field which requires it's own complete university unit to learn, with some people 
even devoting years of research into the topic - it is clearly not reasonable to expect a high school student to do it. This 
question, however, was well within the realms of what we have covered in the unit, requiring only knowledge of fork(), 
exec(), wait(), and some problem solving.

I also agree with Eddie on this. While it was definitely a challenging question, it's quite normal for exams to have one or 
two 'differentiator' questions to distinguish the top students from the good students. I personally had some trouble figuring 
out the proper logic to implement the program, but I did my best given the time constraint, using what I'd learnt throughout 
the semester (and could remember during the exam). 

Looking at the marking of the question too, it's quite generous; it seems it's entirely possible for someone to gain 4-5~ 
marks without even attempting the "multi-core forking" by doing the basics (header files, parameter checking, coherent 
variables, forking and checking for failed fork, main() ). 

Overall I think it was quite a good, interesting question, testing if we really understood fork() and its usage by presenting 
it to us in a different context. There have certainly been questions of unfair difficulty, but in my opinion this was not one 
of them.

A view from an average level student: Despite the question is hard indeed, I really appreciate what I learned in this unit. 
This unit is definitely the hardest one I currently enrolled but it reaches the standard of what I expected a world top 100 
university unit should be. I have learn the c programming in a university in my country and at the end of the semester all I 
learned is some basic application of some basic c statement. After finished this unit, I managed to finish the projects which 
could be impossible for me one year ago. I know how to manipulate the pointers-- used to be the most fearing and unknown 
things for me, and have a basic understanding of how the operating system works. For students, maybe the things they most 
care is whether they can pass the unit or not. Indeed for me it is important too, but more important thing is I learn how to 
solve a problem using programming and the joy of solving and learning new things after I spent many hours. It maybe not fair 
putting a such hard level question for students who didn't expect the exam should be that hard. But it is more like a real 
world, we can not blame the hardness of the question when we are working. Only thing to do is to keep improving the skill 
until to be good enough for solving the problems. That is how Darwin addressed in his evolution theory--"Only the ones strong 
enough could be survived".

Hyperbole is the use of exaggeration as a rhetorical device or figure of speech.

Just wanted to say that the marking key may seem "generous" to you, but keep in mind this unit is attempted by people who aren't 
necessarily amazing at programming. 4-5 marks for basic things like error checking and initializing in my opinion is completely 
valid. Keep in mind that getting 4-5 is the bare minimum to pass. Personally I didn't really understand the question or how to go 
about solving it and to know that I can still get enough marks to at least pass is good to know. Units aren't meant to be passable 
only by the most proficient. But being proficient enough to get the other 5 marks is where the challenge (and higher marks) is.

If I say I liked the chess question will I get full marks for project two?

When can we expect our marks back for project 2? Will we receive them with the exam marks 
or before then?

Your Project-2 marks are now available.  You should be able to see your mark /40 (contributing 20%) in 
csmarks, and you should be able to download your feedback sheet by clicking on its icon.

The average mark of all 183 submitted and marked projects from 276 students was
25.8/40 (after applying late penalties).  Congratulations to the 76 students who received 35 or higher 
/40, and to the 30 students receiving 40/40.

Your mark /40 was composed of up to 20 marks for manual inspection of your code, by one of three 
markers, and up to 20 marks for automated testing including 2 (free!) marks if your program simply
compiled and linked without errors or warnings.  32 project submissions attempted the extra 
defragmentation challenge, with 22 of those receiving 6 / 8 or higher (but very few of those projects 
needed to regain many lost marks).

With reference to your feedback sheet, the average mark for the manual inspection was 13.94/20, broken 
down as:

  READABILITY
    avg=3.17 / 4
  FILE-POINTERS AND DYNAMIC MEMORY
    avg=2.92 / 4
  DEVELOPING COMMON-FUNCTIONS
    avg=1.96 / 4
  FUNCTIONS JUST READING THE VOLUME
    avg=2.85 / 4
  FUNCTIONS MODIFYING THE VOLUME
    avg=3.04 / 4

_____
There are still 19 submitted projects without a mark.  Hopefully these will be concluded tomorrow. If 
your mark appears as Not-Available (as opposed to Not-Submitted) it may be for a couple of reasons:

- you worked with another student who didn't add your details to the
  submission. I emailed all students without a submission on October 29th, but....
  Please speak with your project partner, and *both* of you send me an email to confirm and problems.

- I've already emailed you, stating that your project could not be
  compiled (and hence be tested) and your mark has yet to be finalised.

_____
You may like to check the automated testing of your project. You can download a set of files from:

    http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/projects/testproj2.zip

Download and unpack the Zip archive, which includes the sample solution released Oct 28th, add your 
own submitted project to the library directory, and then run 'make'.  The script should compile the 
sample library and sample applications, compile your library and a set of (the same)applications linked 
with your library, and then run 9 tests comparing the final volumes and outputs.

Remember that your project, as submitted, may have been corrected/modified so that it could be 
compiled and marked.  You may have lost a mark or two (/2), depending on how many changes were required.

(Yes, there are 57 students who did not submit a 2nd project, or have not contacted me yet, and 26 of 
those did not submit a 1st project either)

_____
If, after checking the marking of your project (including running the testing script against your own 
submission), you believe that there's been an error in the marking, then email me BEFORE Monday 18th 
November.

Hi Chris,

Thank you for the solution. Would we be able to obtain the questions to the final exam as 
well? Would be useful to go through them all post exam on my own. Thanks again.

Hi,

I can't release the paper's (other) questions yet, as some of the questions may be repeated in the 
Deferred Exam  (that's why you're required to hand back your paper).

If you come and look at your written paper, once all results are out, we can go through the questions 
then.

Good luck,
