Body:Hello Chris, 1-) Can you please clarify the difference between a shell, terminal and Bash? Are  they the same? Because I keep hearing them but i am not sure if they are used  interchangeably or...? 2-) Just curious, how did you change the colour of your shell's background (or terminal or what ever)? 3-) When you were in the vi editor, how do you switch between the two modes? What do you press? Cheers

Hi,  I'm a bit confused as to where "you're up to" in the steps of:

  http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/labsheets/install-linux.php

If you have a Ubuntu image downloaded and populated with necessary packages - providing the C compiler (essential) and 
your choice of tezt editor (vi/vim recommended if you don't already have a favourite - then you can run a new Linux 
terminal within DockerDesktop, or just through the existing terminal program on your system (my preference, as it saves 
on screen real-estate to use the same terminal program with multiple open tabs).

Then (assuming vi as your editor, and that you have the required C file in your present working directory), you run vi 
and pass the file's name on the command-line:

  prompt>  vi rotate.c

Then you're 'in' vi, and you can issue vi's commands navigate around the file or to edit it (switching backwards and 
forwards between command-mode and insert-mode:

  https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help2002?hl=insert%20mode&a=26 )

When you've made all the edits you wish, you simply leave vi with two capital Z's - ZZ
and you'll be returned to the shell prompt, where you can compile the modified file:

  prompt>  cc -o rotate rotate.c

If there's no compilation errors (otherwise, back to editing....) you can run the successfully compiled program with:

  prompt>  ./rotate  yourstring

Does that help?

(now I'm confused, perhaps by your wording...)
By *data* do you mean:

- the *numeric value* of a data item, or
- the memory address that just happens to be storing data ??

The mapping to and from cache locations <-> main-memory locations is always performed based on the 
address being read or written,  never based on the value (or data of an address) being stored in one 
of those locations.

You do not need a pointer as the parameter to isdigit() - the only valid parameter is a 
character. However, the whole discussion about pointers and their relationship to character 
strings is coming up in a later lecture:

In effect, if you wish to access the first character of the second command-line argument (a string), 
then want:

    char mychar = argv[1][0];

as if you're accessing a 2-dimensional array or characters.

If your program has compiled (without any errors or warnings) and it only crashes when it's 
run, I wonder/suspect that you're not using the suggest switches to 'cc' ?

It looks like you've recently modified your .bashrc or .bash_profile file, to add a new 
line(s) commencing with 'Export'.

However, case is significant to bash, and there is no known command named Export.
The correct command is  'export', all lowercase.

Hello,

I can't quite understand whether you're having problems with the website
(as no-one else has reported similar problems), or not.  I suspect it's
more a mis-understanding about the 'workflow', as the first reply has
explained.

The .coolexe file is available for only 20seconds, because with tens
of students accessing the website at the same time (hopefully not
maliciously!), I wish to keep the disk free of no-longer- required
temporary files.  If you feel that 20secs is not long enough to download
a .coolexe file over a slow network connection, the time limit could be
increased a bit.

Unsure what this means:

  > but then the results are wrong when I execute them.

The code developed in Workshop-5 is a minimal example to get students
started; far from a complete solution against which you should compare
anything (and if it did everything, what would you need to complete??)

It's always the addresses, never the numeric values held in any addresses.

Instructions like CALL and RETURN involve/manipulate the stack (which is in memory) and if CALL pushes something onto 
the stack, and it's still there when you RETURN, you'll get a hit.

You can only read strings from the command line, if you want an argument to be an integer, you have to use the atoi() (ascii to integer) function. Is that the problem?

Because you've defined datacheck[] as an array,  and not as a scalar variable.

Function alpha_val() expects and array as its parameter, so all is good.

In contrast, callval is a scalar variable, which is not what alpha_val() expects.

You can't.  You must pass an array to alpha_val().

You could define callval as an array, instead, and then:

    char callval[1];

    callval[0] = mystr_1[i];

    int returnval = alpha_val( callval );

but I may not understand what you're trying to do with alpha_val().

Whenever you have an array with just one element, rather than using a scalar variable, you 
sometimes need to rethink what you're doing.

There's a few solid reasons for focusing on a single operating system
platform in this unit. The unit has chosen Linux, because it's the world
most widely used OS (even if not on desktops). So it's a vital component
of a student's computing education to be exposed to Linux, and not to
hope that they can just 'cruise' through their degree in the comfort of a
single platform.  This is even more important in a systems-focused unit.
Different CSSE units will have different requirements and opportunities;
for example, in recent years when I've taught Computer Networks, students
were given a choice of programming languages for their project (in fact,
they had to write the project in *two* languages).

Linux can run on the laptop and desktop computers likely owned by
students, making it 'easy' to give students equitable access to the same
platform, enabling students to (eventually) ask and answer questions
about a single platform, and the staff and lab facilitators to more
correctly determine what's being asked.  We had A LOT of difficulty
with the issue last year, as students couldn't attend campus (labs)
and worked on the variety of platforms to which they had access.

Also, pragmatically, to enable project marking and feedback to be as quick
as possible, we need all students to submit work that will be marked on a
single system, and not just on their system of choice;  given the class
size, we don't have the time to mark projects on different platforms,
allowing for the differences between them.

I don't doubt that you've been able to complete the first labsheet and
workshop on macOS (where I do most of my work, too).  But please reflect
on the fact that the first exercises have been chosen to be simple,
introductory, and have made no demands of the OS, and have focused
on writing (simple) programs in a (new) portable programming language.
Later exercises will make demands of the platforms, involving system-calls
(the functional interface between your application programs and the OS)
which are different (and are documented differently) across platforms.

Many of my points about choosing Linux apply here, too.  But it's
never been stated that you must use vi/vim, and their use will not
be examined/assessed.  Your last point is the most relevant - in a
systems-focused unit we believe it's important to expose students to
utilities, such as text editors, that they may see in their careers.
Your favourite graphical editor may not always be available on a platform
you're using, or have to use, particularly over networks (but, yes,
programming life is changing all the time).  There's a reasonable number
of common text editors also widely available - emacs, nano, joe...).
Vi/vim ranks very highly amongst regular users of command-line editors
(and, yes, it's my favourite).

___

You've asked good questions (without fear!), and the reasons are a mix
of exposing students to something other than Windows and GUIs, outside
of their comfort zone,  and to benefit the pragmatics of running a
large unit.

In the long term, students see the benefits of learning different things
and occasionally working outside of their comfort zone - in later year
units (by choice), when applying for careers requiring a breadth of
skills, and (for some) in research.  These different skills are chosen
because they are relevant to the unit's core material, not just to make
life difficult!

Subject:How to actually open rotate.c
Body:Hey, I've got a few questions that I need clarifying;
1) When using ubuntu, do I use it through powershell (I use Microsoft) and docker desktop, or do I directly use it on ubuntu? (Could be a confusing question but I honestly have confused myself siginificantly)
2) I downloaded VIM, supposedly the improved version of Vi, how do I open the rotate.c file through VIM?
3) Depending on the answers to the other questions, this one may be negligent but do I run an ubuntu (myubuntu) container on powershell then supposedly access the rotate.c file through VIM on powershell, and if so how do I access files on my laptop in the terminal? Sorry if these questions have been asked before but I honestly don't know if the other questions I've seen are actually asking the same question, just cause I'm befuddled.
Also I have done this: https://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/labsheets/install-linux.php Pretty much I'm confused on how to open the C file as to start editing it and executing it etc. Thank you so much.

The file "linux-cc-basics.php" is a webpage so, unless you've downloaded it to somewhere on your 
local Windows file-system (such as the Desktop), you will not have it on your local system and, 
thus, cannot display it with 'cat'.

Before running a docker image (to become a container) you need to indicate through its command-
line arguments which parts of your local file-system that docker should able to access.

I believe that this is the same under both Windows and macOS, and has been described here:

If you're returning (or just using) the value on the TOS, then that value must have recently been 
pushed to the TOS.  If you have a cache implemented, that value will be in the cache as a 
consequence of the push, and so shouldn't require a read of main-memory to pop it off again.

Hi,  I'm a bit confused as to where "you're up to" in the steps of:

  http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/labsheets/install-linux.php

If you have a Ubuntu image downloaded and populated with necessary packages - providing the C compiler (essential) and 
your choice of tezt editor (vi/vim recommended if you don't already have a favourite - then you can run a new Linux 
terminal within DockerDesktop, or just through the existing terminal program on your system (my preference, as it saves 
on screen real-estate to use the same terminal program with multiple open tabs).

Then (assuming vi as your editor, and that you have the required C file in your present working directory), you run vi 
and pass the file's name on the command-line:

  prompt>  vi rotate.c

Then you're 'in' vi, and you can issue vi's commands navigate around the file or to edit it (switching backwards and 
forwards between command-mode and insert-mode:

  https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help2002?hl=insert%20mode&a=26 )

When you've made all the edits you wish, you simply leave vi with two capital Z's - ZZ
and you'll be returned to the shell prompt, where you can compile the modified file:

  prompt>  cc -o rotate rotate.c

If there's no compilation errors (otherwise, back to editing....) you can run the successfully compiled program with:

  prompt>  ./rotate  yourstring

Does that help?
