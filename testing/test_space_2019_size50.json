            "Body": "FIRSTLY, if you read nothing else, please read this section.\n\nOur unit this year has a record enrolment - 401 students, up from 320 last\nyear.  Our lecture theatre holds 340, so it'll be an impossible squeeze\nfor the first week.  Further, we don't have sufficient lab times or spaces\nfor all students to be guaranteed a seat in our weekly lab sessions.\n\n*** If you're a student who prefers to NOT ATTEND LECTURES, then this week\n*** will be a great time to make that choice!   I'm confident that from\n*** week-2 our venues will comfortably hold everyone who turns up.\n\n(I'm not panicking about this and I don't think that you'll need\n to either.  In previous years I have worried about this, adding extra\n repeat lectures, only to find that the only available times and venues\n were at 5PM or 6PM;  barely 20 students attended the repeat sessions,\n and students drifted away from the original lectures anyway.)\n\n-------\n\nWe'll spend part of the first lecture on Monday discussing how the unit\nwill run this year, but first I'll head off some common questions that\nstudents are asking by email:\n\nFirstly, we're NOT using LMS/Blackboard for this unit.\nAll information and teaching materials will be available from:\n\n    http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/  -  bookmark it!\n\nLECTURES:\n    We have 2 45 minute lectures each week. All lectures will be recorded\n    and available via LCS. The schedule of lecture topics, in fact all\n    sessions in the unit, is available from the left-margin of the\n    unit's homepage. The HTML of all lectures will be available to read or\n    download ahead of time.\n    Attendance at lectures is not compulsory.\n\nWORKSHOPS:\n    Most weeks we'll hold a workshop on Fridays, to review the week's\n    material by focusing on the design and implementation of a short\n    program addressing a single problem. You'll receive the problem\n    ahead of time, hopefully sketch out a solution, and we'll discuss\n    it in the Friday workshops. The workshops are in our standard lecture\n    venue, not a computing lab, so you should bring your laptops along.\n    Attendance at workshops is not compulsory.\n\nLABORATORIES:\n    The announced laboratory times are times at which there'll be someone\n    there to assist you;  see:\n\n        http://timetable.applications.uwa.edu.au/?selectunits=CITS2002\n\n    Most weeks, when the two projects are not \"running\", will have a\n    laboratory sheet of 3-4 \"standard\" questions, and often a couple of more\n    difficult questions, for you to attempt that week.  Sample solutions to\n    the standard questions will be provided.  If you can successfully complete\n    the sample questions, each week, then you're keeping up in the unit.\n    Attendance at laboratories is not compulsory.  Come along if you need to\n    use a computer, or if you need some help with a question.  There's no\n    requirement to stay the full 2 hours.  Labs are open 24/7 although,\n    of course, students allocated to other units' lab sessions have priority.\n\nI hope that you'll enjoy CITS2002 this semester.\n\nChris McDonald",

One reason is that lab demonstrators are only paid for the time they \nspend helping in labs and when marking assessments,  but the more important \nreason centres around ensuring that all students are treated equitably, and none \nreceive any individual advantage.  For these reasons, our lab demonstrators (and \nme) are not permitted to undertake any private tutoring for students in their \nunits.\n\nI appreciate that your question may be a harmless one, such as \"did anyone find \nmy textbook that I left in the lab?\",  and such questions are perfectly welcome \non our help2002 forum (it doesn't all have to be about the teaching material).\n\nIf you, or anyone, has any more personal questions about their enrolment, or \nperformance in the unit compared to other students, then please contact me by \nemail, or anytime my office door's open (Rm 2.20).\n\nHope this helps.",

We tend to use aliases for short single-line commands, but my \n'vc' is a multi-line command sequence termed a shell function.  Just like 'mycc' it should be added to \nyour  ~/.bash_profile  file, which is read each time you login.\n\nAdd all of lines from 'function vc' to the last '}' to your ~/.bash_profile file.\nInvoking 'vc' will create a new short C file named t.c, but will not overwrite an existing one.\n\n{{{\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfunction vc {\nif [ ! -r t.c ]\nthen\ncat << END_OF_PROGRAM > t.c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <stdbool.h>\n\nint main(int argcount, char *argvalue[])\n{\n\n    return 0;\n}\nEND_OF_PROGRAM\nfi\nvim +7 t.c\n}\n}}}",

We'll me \ndiscussing the what and why of this when discussing memory management in the unit.\n\nThe most common way for your code to trigger the error is for it to access beyond the bounds \nof a fixed-sized array.  If your code is attempting an exercise on our lab sheets, check your \naccesses to the argvalue[] array - ensure that you're not accessing element [argcount] or \nhigher.  Similarly, if you're accessing any other array, ensure that your accesses are not \nbelong [arraysize-1] or even negative.\n\n??",
