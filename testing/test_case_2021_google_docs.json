Because I keep hearing them but i am not sure if they are used  interchangeably or...? 2-) Just curious, how did you change the colour of your shell's background (or terminal or what ever)? 3-) When you were in the vi editor, how do you switch between the two modes? What do you press? Cheers"

I can use isdigit on the individual characters of an argument, but I get an error when I try to use it on the argument. Can you explain why this is the case? Thanks."

(Could be a confusing question but I honestly have confused myself siginificantly)\n2) I downloaded VIM, supposedly the improved version of Vi, how do I open the rotate.c file through VIM?\n3) Depending on the answers to the other questions, this one may be negligent but do I run an ubuntu (myubuntu) container on powershell then supposedly access the rotate.c file through VIM on powershell, and if so how do I access files on my laptop in the terminal? Sorry if these questions have been asked before but I honestly don't know if the other questions I've seen are actually asking the same question, just cause I'm befuddled.\nAlso I have done this: https://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/labsheets/install-linux.php Pretty much I'm confused on how to open the C file as to start editing it and executing it etc. Thank you so much."
