Hello Everyone, welcome to CITS2002 Systems Programming in 2018.

FIRSTLY, if you read nothing else, please read this section.

Our unit this year has a record enrolment - about 320 confirmed
enrolments, up from 305 last year.  Our lecture theatre holds 335,
so it'll be a tight squeeze for a couple of weeks.  and we don't have
sufficient lab times or spaces for all students to be guaranteed a seat
in our weekly lab sessions.

(I'm not panicking about this and I don't think that you'll need to
 either.  (Too many) years of experience have shown that a reasonable
 proportion of students choose to not attend all lectures and a
 weekly lab, choosing to just watch the LCS lecture recordings and
 use their own labtops for all laboratory and project work.  In
 previous years I have worried about this, adding extra repeat
 lectures, only to find that the only available times and venues
 were at 5PM or 6PM;  barely 20 students attended the repeat sessions,
 and students drifted away from the original lectures anyway.)

-------

We'll spend part of the first lecture on Monday discussing how the unit
will run this year, but first I'll head off some common questions that
students are asking by email:

Firstly, we're not using LMS/Blackboard for this unit.
All teaching materials will be available from:

    http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/

LECTURES:
    We have 2 45 minute lectures each week. All lectures will be recorded
    and available via LCS. The schedule of lecture topics, in fact all
    sessions in the unit, is available from the left-margin of the
    unit's homepage. HTML and PDFs of all lectures will be available
    to read or download ahead of time.
    Attendance at lectures is not compulsory.

WORKSHOPS:
    Most weeks we'll hold a workshop on Fridays, to review the week's
    material by focusing on the design and implementation of a short
    program addressing a single problem. You'll receive the problem
    ahead of time, hopefully sketch out a solution, and we'll discuss
    it in the Friday workshops. The workshops are in a lecture venue,
    not a computing lab, so you may wish to bring your laptops along.
    Attendance at workshops is not compulsory.

LABORATORIES:
    The allocated laboratory times are times at which there'll be someone
    there to assist you.  Most weeks, when the two projects are not
    "running", will have a laboratory sheet of 3-4 "standard" questions,
    and often a couple of more difficult questions, for you to attempt
    that week.  Sample solutions to the standard questions will be
    provided.  If you can successfully complete the sample questions,
    each week, then you're keeping up in the unit.
    Attendance at laboratories is not compulsory.  Come along if you
    need to use a computer, or if you need some help with a question.
    There's no requirement to stay the full 2 hours.  Labs are open
    24/7 although, of course, students allocated to other units' lab
    sessions have priority.

I hope that you'll enjoy CITS2002 this semester.

A student sent me this by email, but it's the very sort of question that I'm 
encouraging  you all to post here so that all students can see the answer:

Hi,

Never to early to ask questions about anything.  Your 'guess' is correct, two 
parameters, one an integer count of the number of command-line arguments received by 
the program  (given/passed to the program by the operating system), and the other is 
the actual parameters received (in the manner that C represents character strings).

They are usually pronounced 'arg-c' and 'arg-v',
for argument count, and argument vector.

We'll certainly be covering this is more detail later (Lab 2?), but if you're reading 
ahead in a textbook or online tutorial, the term "command line arguments" will easily 
find something.  Here's an example program demonstrating their use:


#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    printf("number of arguments received: %i\n", argc);
    for(int a=0 ; a < argc ; ++a) {
        printf("  argv[%i] = \"%s\"\n", a, argv[a]);
    }
    return 0;
}


If invoked as:    ./try passing these arguments
you'll see the output:

number of arguments received: 4
  argv[0] = "./try"
  argv[1] = "passing"
  argv[2] = "these"
  argv[3] = "arguments"

Hi Chris,

Many thanks. So if I was to see a program with the header of the main function as:

int main(void)

I would be correct to assume that this program takes no input from the operating system, but can 
still take input from a user through the use of "scanf()" statements. Is this correct?

Hi,

(no real need for post anonymously, here, we're all friends).

More correctly, if the parameters are main(void), then the program has no way of *accessing* its 
parameters - the operating system has no way of knowing if the program *wants/needs* its parameters, so they 
are still passed.

The program can still receive its inputs from many sources - the standard-input stream (via scan() as 
you've suggested), named files, and the process's environment variables  (perhaps more search phases to 
look up!).

Hi Chris.

I have noticed that you have listed quite a few books on this page that will be 
of benefit for us during this unit.

My question is, to achieve a good grade (>D) is it necessary to read most of 
these books or will a single introductory book suffice?

Cheers

Hi Paul,

A single C book, or good online tutorial, will be sufficient;
I have paper copies of most of them, which you're welcome to look over if you like.

(of course your final mark will depend on more than a textbook :-)

Firstly you'll need to install vim on your Windows machine;  you'll find the vim package, and 
instructions and other documentation on the vim website:

  https://www.vim.org
  https://www.vim.org/download.php

and you can then receive more help from websites with the exact same question:

  https://superuser.com/questions/409486/how-do-you-run-vim-in-windows

If using Windows-10 (but not Windows-7), you can further download and install the Linux 
subsystem from which you can invoke vim  (or it may also come with its own copy of vim, or, 
vi - I'm not sure).

Maybe students far more familiar with Windows experience can offer other or better describe 
other options, too.

____
Under Linux it's easier, as a standard terminal program, named xterm, and vi/vim will already 
be installed by a standard distribution.  Running an instance of Xterm, and from inside that 
an instance of vi/vim, should be easy as a terminal menu item will have been installed on the 
desktop menu by default  (with a standard distribution).

Hi Luna,

I am an old-fashioned lecturer who (also) likes to read things on paper rather than on the monitor.

> Can you please get rid of the white space on every page in PDF files when you save as PDF?

I'm unsure what you're asking;  'the white space'?
Each HTML slide/page is first printed as a single PDF page (using wkhtmltopdf), and then all single
PDF pages collated to a single PDF file.
So there's no white space being added, to be removed, because the original is not a single, continuous document.

Can you provide an example of what you wish the PDF would look/print like?

I've placed a copy of last year's 1st workshop on the recording - it's
listed as  "Programming and Systems[CITS2002] workshop, August 06 10:13 AM"
as should still serve as a reasonable introduction to this year' material.

Hi Chris

I'm a bit stuck on this. I've just came from Java and I am trying to understand 
the interaction with a C program once it's compiled. 

Firstly, are methods the same as functions? I don't think they are but not sure.

Secondly, is it possible to have more than one function in a text edit file that 
performs different tasks to other functions? If so, how do you call those 
specific functions that you want to perform the task (I might be pushing towards 
Java here)?  If you write hundreds of calculation (eg. sum = A+B) functions in a 
file and then perform /a.out  what function will execute? 

I guess I don't quite get how you call a so called 'method' like Java in C 
programming.

I'm a pedant for the correct terminology; using the correct terminology quickly 
clarifies what's being discussed or asked.
C has functions, and that's it.  Some functions in C return a value, such as an integer 
or character,  some C functions don't return a value (termed 'void functions' which 
we'll discuss soon).

C does not have methods; Java has methods, which explicitly act on an object, setting 
or getting properties of that object.  No objects in C, so not methods.

The C code inside the 1st labsheet file rot.c is an example of a C program that has 
multiple functions - one named main, the other named rotate.

When a program is first invoked/executed, the operating system finds the in-memory 
address of the main function, and commences execution of the instructions from that 
address.  It is not possible to commence the execution of a program from, say, the 
rotate function.  Just main.

If you wrote a program named, say, arithmetic and you wanted to use it as:

  ./arithmetic 3 + 7
  ./arithmetic 12 / 4
  ./arithmetic -7 - 10

then, because execution can only begin at main, you'd probably write your code in main 
to determine what needs to be executed (based on +, /, or -) and then main would call 
one of the program's three other functions to perform the required arithmetic.

?

Took me a few hours to get some idea of how to do this on Windows natively. (I heard it's significantly easier 
on the average Linux distribution due to it being Unix-like or something, which I'm looking into right now)

Step 1: Get the following software:

*A text editor of choice, I love Vim. Get it from one of the following websites:
https://www.vim.org/download.php
https://chocolatey.org/packages/vim

*A compiler of choice, MinGW seems to do the job for now. Get it from here: 
http://www.mingw.org/
https://chocolatey.org/packages/mingw

*(Optional, shameless plug, I promise I'm not just a 'shill') A package manager for Windows, like chocolatey 
(Required if you use the second of the links I provided). Available here:
https://chocolatey.org/install

Step 2: Read up on the difference between 'DOS commands' and 'Unix commands'. Learn to navigate the Windows cmd, 
which seems to be DOS-like. Useful links below:
http://www.dba-oracle.com/t_windows_dos_unix_linux_commands.htm
https://www.digitalcitizen.life/command-prompt-how-use-basic-commands

Step 3: Read the week 1 lab-sheet carefully.
http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/labsheets/labsheet1.php

Step 4: Have 'fun' navigating text files without touching the mouse using Vim/gVim, the built-in vimtutor is a 
good weekend activity and relatively productive procrastination.

Step 5: Open up cmd, via the Start menu (Start button) or the Run menu (Ctrl+R). Follow the instructions as 
outlined in the week 1 lab-sheet. Replace any mention of cc with gcc, and Unix-like commands with DOS-like 
commands.
For example: 
ls → dir
rm blah rot → del blah rot
cc -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -o rot rot-warning.c → gcc -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -o rot rot-warning.c

Or you can give up on Windows and use Linux or OSX and follow the lab-sheet to the letter and possibly have a 
slightly easier time. Or use an IDE like Visual Studio Code.

Hopefully, the guide above helped you a bit and wasn't too overly confusing/badly written. Anyone who is more 
informed on using Windows/aforementioned tools than I am, please don't hesitate to correct/improve my answer, 
because as I mentioned before, I learnt this through 2 hours of Googling and am a fellow student who is new to 
this as well.

Thanks for your detailed response Alan; sounds like 2hrs of learning well spent, and now shared.

Just a couple of clarifications, prompted from earlier questions:

Microsoft's Visual Studio coding platform does not have full (or clear) support for C; they dropped support for C at least 5 
years ago.  Visual Studio does support C++ (though I can imagine that support will be dropped eventually as MS pushes 
further with C#).

However, C and C++ are different languages; historically C++ was spawned from C, but they now follow two distinct standards, 
and neither is a superset nor subset of the other.  Yes, you can write a program that compiles and runs successfully with 
either a C or a C++ compiler, 

This webpage appears to give a reasonable summary:
  http://cs-fundamentals.com/tech-interview/c/difference-between-c-and-cpp.php

So while you can develop C++ programs, with only C features, within Visual Studio, the quality and accuracy of the support 
will diminish with more complicated programs.

___
It's a bigger task, but the C compiler supported on macOS, named Clang, and the C compiler supported on Linux, named gcc,

But you're not been encouraged to give up on Windows, nor being forced to use a weird platform, but given the opportunity to 
learn and use one of the 'other' 3 contemporary desktop operating systems. We're all here to learn (presumably).

Hi,

Sorry Alan if this disregards all your hard work, but I think I managed to find something easier for Windows users.

Download Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/) 

It seems to be very similar to the "Mac Terminal", and we can use UNIX commands in it and run Vim too.

Do make sure to download the basic Vim package while installing cygwin. 
https://superuser.com/questions/345180/install-vim-in-cygwin
This should teach you how to do that.

Hope it helps all Windows users.

Alternatively Alan's solution is also perfectly fine.

Chris McDonald,

I asked around about this, and I'm not too sure if this is completely relevant, but I heard that 
certain other universities in have remote access to their school setups through protocols such as 
SSH to allow their students to have the same environment as others without having to stay on campus 
24/7. I'm not too familiar with it, but does UWA have anything similar to this?

Thanks

That solution looks very promising to me, and I'll try it out, but I was aiming to find a way to achieve all of the above 
with as 'native' of a Windows experience as possible if that's even a thing.

Hi guys

I'm a bit stuck on Q9 in lab1. I've created a new function the utilises fopen 
and then copies the data in the file into a buffer. 

Here is the code: https://hastebin.com/lofapuwaho.cpp

Now where I am stuck is how to incorporate this function into main. 

In psuedo code this is what i'm thinking: 
 
Main
-Check if argument is a digit, if yes that is new ROT value.
-Check if argument matches a filename in directory using rotFile (as per code 
pasted above).
- If yes, copy the data in that file into a buffer using fopen,fseek,ftell, 
fread.
- If rotFile returns cyphered text then that is a success
- If it returns return_val = 0 then cypher text by ROT 13.


Is this possible or is there another way to go about it?

Thanks!

I'm not sure if how I did it is best but I managed it by using the code below 
and it seemed to work. Essentially it just tries to open the file and if it can 
reads and rotates the characters from the file one at a time until it reaches 
the end of file. 

FILE *myfile = fopen(argv[i], "r");

if(myfile == NULL) {
	fprintf(stderr, "%s: could not be opened", argv[i]);
}
else {
	char ch;
	while((ch = fgetc(myfile)) != EOF) {
		printf("%c", rotate(ch));
	}
}

Hi,

Actually, there's a number of things going on there:

Firstly, the traditional (30 year old) way to run the vim editor *is* inside the same window
that receives your shell commands.  On more modern(!) graphical displays we've been using the
mvim, or gvim, commands which simply popup a stand-alone copy of the editor in its own window.
I choose to edit files and compile them in the same window during tutorials (and in most of my
work) to simply save screen real-estate.  So you can run the vim editor in the single window by
simply executing the 'vim file.c' command at the prompt, and then leaving the editor with either

    :wq!<RETURN>
or  ZZ

when finished editing  (or just  :q!  to quit without saving changes).

The second part is more complex, and will be covered later in the unit.
Processes may be in one of a number of states - (simplified definition):

  - running in the foreground, receiving keyboard input
  - suspended, not running, receiving no input, or
  - running in the background, receiving no input.

When working (as in tutorials) I first invoke a copy of the vim editor, and it runs in the
foreground receiving input from the keyboard.  I then type 2 keys at once - Control-Z - which
suspends the vim process.  The shell notices this, and issues the next prompt, and which I can
run the compiler again (or any other commands).  When I wish to resume execution of the vim
process - shifting it from suspended to foreground - I type 'fg', the shell becomes suspended,
vim resumes, detects that it's again running in the foreground, and redraws the screen.

For this sequence to be effective, you also need the editor to write its changes to disk before
becoming suspended. Either you can do this manually, which gets tiring and you may forget, or
you can ask vim to do it automatically by setting an internal vim setting -

  :set autowrite<RETURN>

Then, just before vim is suspended it writes its changes to disk, and the next compilation, etc,
will be performed using the updated C file.

In much the same way that shell aliases can be saved between visits, vim's settings can also be
saved in a file named  ~/.vimrc   which you can edit with vim itself, adding the line:

  set autowrite     (no leading colon).

From: chris.mcdonald@uwa.edu.au
X-smilie: none

The “Obfuscated C Contest” is a well-known competition that challenges programmers to write obscure/obfuscated C 
programs.  Though not a requirement, many of these programs are structured in a manner that spells out words or 
images; see for example https://www.ioccc.org/2018/endoh2/prog.c  (All the winners of the 2018 contest are available 
at https://www.ioccc.org/years.html#2018 )
 
The ACM Inroads Back Page “Programs-as-Art” contest builds on the idea of code as art and has two categories:
 
1. ACM/Computing.  Programs in this category must be organized to show some word or image related to ACM or 
computing, e.g., the word “ACM”, “INROADS”, “SIGCSE”, “50” (for the 50th year of SIGCSE), images of some piece of 
hardware, etc.  See the link given above for an example of a program as an image.  The program must also compile, run 
and print out text relating to ACM.  For example, it could print the names of all Turing Award winners or the names 
of all the ACM SIGs, etc.  The output may, but does not have to be, an image.
 
2. Open.  Programs in this category may be organized to show any word or image.  The program must also compile, run 
and print out text relating to word/image of the program.  The output may, but does not have to be, an image.

The best entries in each category (judged by the Inroads editorial staff) will appear in a future issue of Inroads 
magazine on the Back Page.
 
________
Rules:
 
1. You must use one of the following languages:  Java, C, C++, C#. If you would like to use a different language that 
has an open-source compiler or interpreter, contact John at barr@ithaca.edu.

2. Your program must be a project that opens in one of the following environments:  Netbeans, Eclipse, Visual Studio 
or IntelliJ.  You may also have text files together with a Makefile that can be processed by the GNU “make” program 
and compiled using gcc or g++. 

3. You may only use standard libraries (whatever that means).

4. All code must be in a single compressed folder.  There must be one main file (it can have any name) that will be 
judged for the contest.  There may be any number of axillary files.

5. You must include a README file that describes the program, its output and how to compile and run it and that 
identifies the file with the main function/class.

6. The program must be an original program written by you (team entries are allowed and encouraged).  You must have 
all rights to the program.

7. If the editors cannot get your program to compile and run, it will not be considered for the contest.

Entries are due by 1 December 2018.  Student entries are encouraged.

is there any way of editing the 'vim' command to open the macVim app instead?
I made an alias called 'vim' which opens macVim but I can't put more than one argument and 
it kind of makes things messier (maybe i didn't do it perfectly).

ie. vim                   //opens macVim.app
    vim ~/.bash_profile   //doesn't open .bash_profile in macVim.

not really sure how to explain it properly but i'd like to be able to use;

'vim ~/dirname/filename.txt' so that it opens 'filename.txt' in macVim not the standard 
terminal shell vim. 

thanks for any suggestions. a bit off-topic.

nevermind, setting the default to open c files with macVim and then just using 'open filename.txt' was

session in room 2.03, if it was someone from this unit I've handed them in to the
Computer Science reception if you'd like to claim them.

Hi Chris,

(no consolation, but) I see the same problem myself.
Manual, not from putty, I can ssh into a lab machine but it will not validate passwords.  I 
know that our Faculty IT group are making changes to the lab to also support other units so, 
maybe, they're part way through that change.  Will let you know when I receive a reply.

As an indication of how powerful contemporary computers have become over the past 20 
years, someone has recently released a project to enable Windows'95 (OS and applications) 
to run as a user-level application (not a virtual machine) on macOS, Windows, and Linux:

    https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/23/17773180/microsoft-windows-95-app-download-features

And lots of discussion about why this only serves to demonstrate how bloated today's operating systems are:

    Windows'95 OS - 120MB
    Facebook app  - 496MB
    https://apple.slashdot.org/story/18/08/24/0321235/windows-95-is-now-an-app-you-can-download-and-install-on-macos-windows-and-linux

   "OK, so let me get this right. Windows-95 ran fine on real hardware
    with 4MB of memory, and 16MB on a high-end system. And now this guy is
    delighted to have the same stuff running in 'only 200MB'??"

The simplest way to find the answer to your question is to read the online manual entry for 
fgets.  On macOS, the command   man fgets  reports:

    "The fgets() function reads at most one less than the number of char-
     acters specified by size from the given stream and stores them in
     the string str.  Reading stops when a newline character is found, at
     end-of-file or error.  The newline, if any, is retained.  If any
     characters are read and there is no error, a `\0' character is
     appended to end the string."

So, if you're calling  fgets(str, sizeof str, filepointer)

the function will read characters using the filepointer, until it finds a newline sequence or 
the end-of-file condition, copying each read character into your character array, str, and 
appending a NULL-byte character to enable you to treat those characters as a string.

You get rid of the error by adding a newline at the end of the file (using your text 
editor).  The original file contains a newline character at its end, so how did you 
download/copy it?

I downloaded it as it is and I got the error, I have tried to add printf("\n");, and i still got 
the error, is that what you meant by adding a newline?

You don't have to add any code - just add an empty line underneath the final brace and save.

Hello everyone,

I'm looking for a partner for the upcoming project.
Just a heads up, I'm a C noob so if you don't mind partnering with me, hit me up!
My lab times are on Mondays at 2pm but I'm happy to work with anyone!

Kind regards,

(19) Which one of the following will generally NOT result in a process’s 
termination:
A. an attempt to execute an invalid instruction.
B. an attempt to write data to a full disk-drive.
C. a per-process time limit has been reached.
D. an attempt to access memory not owned by the process.

This is the question from the mid-term exam last year. I am wondering why C is not 
correct? Although the time quantum is reached, the process will either be blocked or 
suspended waiting for I/O instead of being terminated?
For choice B, if the process still tries to write data, will the original data in 
the full disk be covered?
Thanks!

Hey mate,
My lab is also on Monday, 2-4pm. I can't make 
it there for this week, but I'll be there next 
week. If you are down I'd be more than happy 
to partner with you.

This is one of those things you kind of have to know, but you can sort or reason
your way towards the answer.

It is not A as if after an invalid instruction execution was allowed to continue
then this would result in heavily undefined behaviour, as well as possibly being a
security risk.

It would make sense to be B as image you are typing out some document, hit save and
the program crashes and you loose all your work because the drive is full. This
would be very rude and possibly impossible to work around, and OS's try not to be
rude and always try to allow you to recover from possible runtime errors.

I'm not sure what they meant by C exactly, but I think they are not talking about a
sheduleing time limit, more of a stopped responding time limit. Which would make
sense to terminate a program that has stopped responding.

D is a very similar situation to A, and if you spend more time with C/C++ you will
become very familiar with Seg Faults, which are what you get if you try this. 

So from this B is the most reasonable answer

Due to the rescheduling etc. it is likely to take until the end of this week or
potentially into early next week to be posted. There will probably be a post on this
help forum once the project is released as well if you want to monitor this forum.

I used heaps of different numbers and as with most numbers including 28 it doesn't work for any 
of them. The closest I've got is 2.8 from 28. It turns out there is an unstated major premise in 
the question that all numbers with at lease two digits end with a zero. Technically there is no 
unambiguous answer to this question.

I believe it's because the increment function is of type void. Meaning that it
cannot return a value.

Hi Matthew,

Using Edberts easy to read layout, 28 returns the tens digit for both answers.

Assume the variable x is 28:

Using B: 
x % 100 / 10 
= 28 % 100 / 10
= 28 / 10
= 2

Using D:
x / 10 % 100
= 28 /10 % 100
= 2 % 100
= 2

Using B will always give the tens digit.

Using D will always give the hundreds and tens digits for any number over 100.

Fractions are discarded for integer division.

Cheers,

Jason

Yep agree.

You will need something like this for the code to work:

int increment(int i) {
    i++;
    return i;
}
 
void go(void) {
    int i = 0;
    int sum = 0;

    for(i = 0; i < 10; i = increment(i)) {
        sum = sum + i;
    }
    printf("Final value of i = %i\n", i);
}

Hi, although you are right about void not being able to return a value, it's not 
quite right for this question! So the reason the answer is D (None of the above) is 
because the printed value will always be above 10.

This is because of the sum variable and the way sum and i is expressed.

After the 2nd iteration ( initially i = 0 and sum = 0):

i = 1 and sum = 1

3rd iteration

i = 2 and sum = 3

4th iteration

i = 3 and sum = 6

Here, we can see that the value of sum will be greater than 10 before i reaches 9 
and hence why none of the options are correct except for D.

That is all good. I am sure a lot of other people would have made the same mistake. 

I ran the original code. It compiles but the increment function is never read and the code is stuck 
in an infinite loop and thus will never print i out. If you throw a print sum statement in the:

sum = sum + i part

0 is printed out infinitely.

Hi Jason,

SO in this case, the code will not work at all because i will not be increased after 
each iteration?

I.e some error will appear be in compile time or run time?

Hi Chiang

Not sure of your question sorry.

I checked and there are no errors in my code. 

Perhaps you didn't include a main function in your code?

Two things to watch for this question.

Firstly, the increment function will successfully increase the value of i in its own 
scope, that is the i value in the function increment() itself, not the i value in 
the for loop in go(). As such, the value of i in the for loop will never change and 
will be stuck in an infinite loop. 

Secondly, even if the i value does increase, the expected output should be 9 as it 
is not printing the sum but the value of "i".

You sound educated so I hope you're not trying to mislead people on purpose.

The value of "i" will be 10, not 9 if the "i" value increases by 1 each iteration.

Hello Everyone,

Firstly, sorry about the disruption caused to the Test and Project schedule while I was 
out-of-action.  But a big thanks to Ryan, Daniel, and Jordan for carrying through the 
disruption, and I'm very confident that everyone will have the same opportunity to learn 
just as much from this unit this semester (no material is being dropped, just its order 
rearranged).

Daniel will be presenting the two lectures this week, Mon and Tue, so please welcome him 
to this role.

As you will already have noticed, instead of two 15% smaller projects, we're setting 
just one 30% project, with the same deadline of the last day of semester, and the same 
6-week total to complete it.  I'm confident that this will work out well for all of us, 
as you'll actually have more time to think about and design your project, with less 
stress provided by the single deadline.

We'll also have one more labsheet, #5, this week before the project is released at the 
end of the week, to provide you with a few more skills that will help you in the 
project.  This just replaces the labsheet that was previously scheduled between the two 
projects.  All dates, etc, are up-to-date on our Schedule page:

    http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/schedule.php

I haven't heard any horror stories about the mid-semester test (or you're just very 
polite), and they should be marked by UniPrint and returned by about Thursday this week.

Please ask any general questions through this forum, as I'm back to reading it every day 
now.

Good luck,

You should now be able to see your test results in csmarks.

302 students sat the test.
Congratulations to the 19 students receiving full marks.

The average mark was 13.5 / 20, stddev=5.0, but this includes 25 enrolled students recorded as 
0 because they didn't sit the test, and I don't (yet?) have a Special Consideration outcome 
form for them.

Without the zeroes, the average was 14.6 / 20 (was 13.4 in 2017).
This is a very pleasing outcome, as it suggests that the message not to undertake CITS2002 
without past success in another programming unit is getting through (and next year we can get 
back to a more difficult test :-)

Your scanned test paper is available as "feedback" in csmarks - please

I haven't used the Linux bash shell on Windows-10, but everything I've previously read about it has 
been positive (with the 'irrelevant' issue of some interprocess communication system calls).

The C code posted in your 2nd post is certainly not a definitive test of whether Linux bash shell on 
Windows-10 will fully support our project's requirements but, given that you've installed gcc and the 
preprocessor has "got that far", it's very likely that you'll be able to complete the project on this 
environment.

HOWEVER, please keep in mind that your submission will (still) be compiled, run, and examined using the 
macOS platform on computers in CSSE Lab 2.03.  Leave enough time (and don't hope for the last day 
before the deadline) to ensure that your project works (compiles and tested) on macOS.

Good luck,

Hi, I just have a couple things I wish for clarification on:

1) Using make with multiple -f command line flags you are able to select multiple
makefiles, are we expected to support multiple -f flags in the same way?

2)In the project, it says that the -p flag will not actually run the bakefile just
print internal info and "Then simply exit with success". But with make the -p flag
still runs the makefile on top of printing internal information. So definitely just
do what the project says to do?

Thanks

Hi Nicholas,

It is Jason.

If you haven't found a partner could we work together?

P.S. I do not fully understand the lecture, we can also study this unit together=]

Best regards,

Just support a single file provided by the -f option.
If -f is provided multiple times, just process the last file presented:

   ./bake -f file1 -f file2

would just process the spec in file2.

Yes, just print the internal representation of the spec but do not
execute any target's actions.  In many places, bake's actions are much
simpler (requires less work) than make.

Just to clarify your wording, too;  we don't say that we "run the bakefile" (which 
I've seen confuse some students that believe it needs to be executable).
We run bake, which reads and processes the contents of the bakefile.

Good luck,

Based on the number of requests that our school receives for high quality 
programmers, most posted on csforum, I don't believe there's currently a shortage 
of positions for quality programmers. Quality.  And we shouldn't be calling for 
'just' more positions for programmers, if the need for quality programmers is 
already being met.

Yes (unlike LMS) you don't need to login via Pheme or SSO to read the articles, only to 
post new articles.  The same is true for units whose teaching materials are outside of 
LMS.

If memory is allocated to a pointer 
inside a function is it necessarily not 
overwritten elsewhere??

What I've written of the project so far 
is littered with the following scenario:

void some_function(char **strarray)
{
  strarray[M] = malloc(sizeof(char) * P);
  strcpy(strarray[M], "string of length 
P-1");
}

char **strarray = malloc(sizeof(char*) * 
N);
some_function(strarray);
//Other code needing strarray not to be 
overwritten

It doesn't throw out warnings or errors 
and seeeems to work. But I haven't found 
anywhere saying whether or not it is 
necessarily persistent.

Cheers.

Even with your example, it's a bit difficult to understand the question.

If you allocate memory inside a function, and assign that memory's address to a local 
variable or parameter of that function, or to a global variable,  then the allocated 
memory is not overwritten, re-used, or deallocated when the function returns.  Thus you 
can use a function to perform the allocation (and test for its success :-) and then use 
the allocated memory from within another function(s).

You can reason about these semantics because, if it were not the case, then the standard 
function strdup() could not work as expected.

Hope that makes sense.

Hi Chris,

I was just having a look over the lecture notes and found what appears to be a minor error 
in the following link which provides the correlation.c file:

http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/lectures/lecture12/src/correlation.c

No big deal, but I think the following code:
sumxx   += (projmarks[n] * exammarks[n]);

Should be:
sumxx   += (projmarks[n] * projmarks[n]);

Cheers,

Hi,
The project description page mentions several times about the project code being C99 
code. However, the page also suggests to use the function strdup(), but according to 
some Google searching it is not part of the C99 standard library. Are we allowed to 
use this function? Or do we need to implement our own version of it if we want to use 
it?
Thanks in advance

There is no conflict in the description.  None of the operating system calls that you'll 
require to complete the project are part of the C99 standard library, either, so using 
strdup() is not a problem.

Use the system-provided strdup() function though - no need, and no point, implementing your 
own.

Hi Matthew,

Answers to both of these questions are specified in the project description:

    "As special cases, the variable expansions $(PID), $(PPID), $(PWD), and $(RAND) are replaced by the 
    results of the function calls getpid(), getppid(), getcwd(), and rand() formatted as strings, 
    respectively."


Previously, <poster093@student.uwa.edu.au> wrote:

> define variables?

You could override/redefine the value of, say, PID with your own value
but, as the above states, when $(PID) is expanded it provides the value
given by the function call.

 
> And what has higher priority the special variables or environment variables?

I think you're asking the same question a different way.
The special cases always expand to their function's results.
Consider $(RAND), which should produce a different expansion each time it is requested.

No, just zero or more targets on the command-line.
As per the project description, its invocation is:

  bake  [command-line-options]  [targetname]

If multiple targets were required, it'd state: .... [targetnames] or [targetname ....]  
(plural).

Hi all I was going through the week 7 lectures and trying the command lines introduced in 
the lecture. Specifically "free" and "pmap". 

However these were not working. The bash error message was "-bash: pmap: command not 
found". 

The same happened when i used sudo pmap. I couldnt see any solutions online at first 
glance, and when I typed man pmap I got the error: "No manual entry for pmap".

When I typed man free I got the man pages for number 3 - as in systems calls and not a 
command line argument - perhaps that is the hint, but I saw the lecture use it as a command 
line argument.

Any help would be appreciated. Don't post very often so I'm not sure how well the question 
is phrased.

My OS is macOS Sierra 10.12.6, Processor: 2.9 GHz Intel Core i7 not sure if theres anything

The notes should have said so (will correct them),
but both programs are available under Linux (but not macOS).

Hi,
I was wondering if our program should read through the Bakefile (during default operation 
with no command line arguments) and just rebuild all targets that need rebuilding?
 
And then am I correct in saying that if a target is specified on the command line, then 
bake.c *only* checks if that specific target needs rebuilding (and rebuilds it if 
required)?

Your project may be tested with such command sequences,
but your project won't care (nor even need to understand them),
as all actions are executed by a shell program, not directly by bake.

To just confirm, when you say:

" If the pattern $(NAME), known as a variable expansion, appears anywhere on any
following text line, the pattern $(NAME) is replaced at that point by the characters
of VALUE."

And particularly the 'on any following text line' part you mean that a variable can
only be subbed into a line below it and if it is redefined then subs below that will
use the new value, such that this would be invalid:

A = $(B)

B = C

Unlike how in Make that would be valid and A would equal C, and variables can't be
redefined in the sense that it will only ever use the last defined?

Also one other thing,

In Make you can't do variable subbing on the left side like you can here, and these
lines would fail in Make: 

A = =
B $(A) C

But this works:

A = :

targ $(A)
        echo Test

So, I am not sure if the first should fail in Bake or what?

For those of you who have decided to use WSL to try and make the project, I have
been doing that and it works perfectly for everything except in one area. When it
comes to getting the results from curl, the stuff is VERY temperamental and NOT
stable. For example, some invalid address just returns 404 or whatever, but others
just crash, whereas identical code in a Linux VM works perfectly 100% of the times I
have tested it. 

So beware.

Yes; treat a required but missing header as a form of error.
While curl may report a successful request (giving the response code of 200), not all URLs 
can 'provide' a "Last-Modified" HTTP header.

For example, a URL corresponding to a remote disk file can report a "Last-Modified" value, 
but dynamically generated content does not correspond to an on-disk file,  e.g.

  curl --head http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/

reports no "Last-Modified" value because its delivering PHP output.

I'll have to reword that, and write a clarification.
For example, see what make does with this  (which bake should do similarly):

A = B

t1:
        echo $(A)

A = C

However, the focus of the project is on the reading of text files, dynamic memory 
management, file attributes, and process management - and not being able to parse 
complex lines in the file.  So don't fear that your project will be tested against 
'weird' specification;  treat anything beyond the basics described on the question 
sheet as an error (report and exit).

What is "the current point"? Is it where the variable is defined or the place where the variable is

 And if it is the latter does this mean to insert an empty string before $(NAME)?

If the line being expanded is:

   aaa$(NAME)bbb

then, if NAME has the value VALUE, the result will be:

   aaaVALUEbbb

If NAME is unknown, the result will be:

Yes, although be careful about your own wording.

In the act of building the required target, bake (or make) may, as a side-effect, build other targets.

Consider examples that we've already seen - in the calcmarks 'project', the required target may be the actual name 
of the final program, but in order to build that target, other targets (such as some object files) may be built in 
determining/evaluating the dependencies of the required target.

Hello, the -p option states:

"-p : after reading in the specification file, print its information (from bake's internal 
representation) to stdout with all variable expansions performed. Then simply exit with 
success."

When you say "(from bake's internal representation)", does this imply you want us to 
reconstruct a valid bakefile from what we've parsed, and print that?

Or is simply expanding the variables in the existing bakefile and printing it enough? 
Currently I am just printing the lines directly from the bakefile (including comments/empty 
lines), with just the variables expanded.

For example, given the bakefile:
> VAR = value1
> Bar = value2 + $(VAR)
>
> # Some target
> myTarget : $(BAR)
> 	someCommand $(VAR)

My implementation prints:
> VAR = value1
> Bar = value2 + value1
>
> # Some target
> myTarget : value2 + value1
> 	someCommand value1

But would you like us to print:
> myTarget : value2 + value1
> 	someCommand value1

The intention of asking for the internal representations, sort of a reverse engineering of your 
program's internal data structures,  was that it would be a good (visual) test/confirmation that 
your data structures have been constructed correctly, and would be ready for building any targets.  
There would thus be no comments or unnecessary blank lines in the output from the -p option.

As with Mathhew's questions about variable expansion

   https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help2002?p=np&a=196&all=y5

the output will depend on when they're expanded (which I'm just rewording).

It shouldn't be a problem for your code, even if you encountered one.
If you're reading in each text line with fgets(), each call to fgets() will stop reading when it 
encountered  newline sequence, the end of file, or an error.  So if the last read from your file 
doesn't end in a newline sequence, fgets() will still perform as expected.

C does not require its input files to end with a blank line (a blank line is represented by two 
newline sequences in a row).

Hello Chris,

I can't quite follow your explanation, but you shouldn't need to have your home 
directory available/mounted on uggp.csse.uwa.edu.au to be able to successfully login to 
a lab Mac.

Does uggp report 'directory not found' or something more detailed about not being able 
to actually create a directory?

Anyway, once you login to uggp,  change directory to /tmp
and see if you can then ssh to 130.95.252.135 from there.

I'm not sure what materials you've been reading, but it sounds like you haven't been 
keeping up with or attempting the unit's exercises before the project.  We have 
undertaken a number of similar exercises/challenges whose approaches and code can be 
freely re-used.

I suggest that you review Labsheet 5 (for the mywc example) and Workshop 6 (for the 
concordance example).

From: chris.mcdonald@uwa.edu.au

X-img: none
X-announcefor: 5d

A number of students have asked what a Bakefile looks like, how it differs from a 
Makefile, and why the project requires you to submit one of each.

The format of a Bakefile (read/understood by bake) is a subset of the possible 
things that can be defined or requested in a Makefile (read/understood by make). 
bake is only supporting a subset of make's features;  similarly a Bakefile can 
only contain a subset of a Makefile's possible contents.  In addition, bake is 
able to recognise that a target's dependency may be a URL; make does not support 
this.

Look at Lecture 12 - the Makefiles (in grey boxes) on p12, p13, and p14 each 
include basic (make) features, and each are also possible Bakefiles.  The 
Makefile on p15 contains an additional feature (automatic variables, on orange) and 
is NOT a possible Bakefile.

Please note that there's a difference in how/when variable expansion is performed 
by bake and make.  With bake, variable expansion is performed at the time the 
$(X) pattern is read/detected - the current value of X, if any, is substituted at 
that time and point. This is true for all Bakefile lines following X's variable 
definition.  In make, variable expansion within actions is delayed until the 
action is executed (this provides make's support for automatic variables, which 
is NOT supported/required in bake).

Alright, so we would be expected to reconstruct it. Do you want variable definitions to be outputted as well? Or 
just the targets, their dependencies, and their action lines.

How much of a penalty would there be for doing things in a ~decent~ but not optimal 
way?

I completely wrote the definition replacement functions and the treating of the 
command line options before knowing about structs (and so used 2D arrays of strings 
i.e. char***) or about getopt() (and so wrote my own argument parsing routines) 
they're pretty well tested and, in my opinion, readable. Would it be a very bad 
choice to leave it as is for submission??

To maybe make the odds of getting the answer I want a little bit worse; the argument 
parsing function doesn't do the same things as getopt() i.e. "-si" is not considered 
valid, as is "-fBakefile", and "-p -n" are considered incompatible options (all throw 
out errors). However, it does conform with what's explicitly requested from the 
project spec.

Yes;  it's a good practice to reconstruct (typically more complex) data structures, once built, as a 'proof' that 
you've built them correctly.

The project spec. does omit what's required :-(
so let's only *require* targets, dependencies, and actions  (after variables are have been expanded).

It's fewer than 10 additional lines to also print variables (names and values), but once expanded they're no 
longer required in our project.

Thanks for the question,

Of course it's technically possible (the C compiler has no practical limit on the size 
of a source file), but the real question is, knowing that it is a very (very) good 
practice to use design and develop using multiple source files (possibly, even, 
multiple header files), "why would you want to"?

The section titled 'Assessment' on the project sheet also states: "20
marks will come from ... isolation of distinct responsibilities in
separate source files." - maybe that should be an incentive.

curl is a utility program (external to bake), so it's RETURN VALUE is really its exit status 
(i.e. did it execute successfully, or not).  That's easy to determine.

However, that's not the question you're asking.
What you're seeing appear on your terminal, printed by curl, is its output, not its return 
value.  Have another look in curl's manual to see how you can capture that, rather than 
having it "disappear" to the screen.

Just use the external program, not libcurl - it's far more difficult to learn and use than 
what you're trying.

Of course; just as described in Lecture 12:
   http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/lectures/lecture12/10.html

Lecture 12 also provides suitable Makefiles, that you could cut-and-paste and modify in 2 
minutes.

I'm unsure where you got that thought.
The project requires you to submit a Makefile for your project.

I've been out of action for the last 3 or so weeks due to work commitments and have crammed 
all the content into this weekend.. Just needing some clarification on the project if 
possible; not sure how specific we can go.

I'm presuming we are to submit a '.c' source file for each of the sections outlined in the 
assignment description (e.g. readSpecFile.c, implementVariableDef.c etc) and a header file 
for the '.c' files. Provided this is correct as a general structure to the assignment, my 
confusion is why we submit a Makefile as well as a Bakefile. Why not just a Bakefile?

Sorry if it's a layman's question, just a bit confused. thanks

When developing your project, before your project is able to build itself, you'll want to use 
make to compile and link the C files (as you've described above).  When your project is 
marked, your Makefile will be used to rebuild your project so that it can be tested.  
Realistically, a number of submitted projects will not work, even to an early stage, and 
submitting a Makefile may help demonstrate some understanding as to how far 'it got'.

In your main function, in bake.c, you're calling a function named getsaction()

(If you have already solved the sub-problem of reading long text lines that continue on

However, there's a number of students really struggling to solve this problem, some in 
an elegant way, some in any way at all, and it's clearly preventing them from making 
much progress in the project.

So, in the hope that this will help those get over the hurdle, and get deeper into the 
project, please feel free to use this code:

  http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/project/readcontinuationlines.c

Read the code in main(), and see how the function nextline() is used in a similar way to 
our traditional use of fgets().

And if you already have your own, working, better solution, then please keep using it!

Good luck,

In the project guidelines, under target lines, it says "C99 functions and OS system-calls 
that will help you implement target lines, ... gettimeofday() ...". 

My understanding is that the target needs rebuilding if any of the following apply:

1.) there are dependencies that are newer than the target
2.) there are no dependencies
3.) one or more of the dependencies does not exist
4.) the target does not currently exist.

None of those four situations includes anything related to the current time and date as far 
as I can tell so I'm confused to why the command would be necessary? Is there some part 
where this function is needed where maybe I'm not considering all the cases?

If you build a target (invoke its actions), but those actions don't actually produce a file with the 
same name as the target, you may wish to ascribe a time to when that target was built  (depending on 
your implementation).

This issue was identified by a tutor and was told to think of another way to implement our 
code. Currently, our way of identifying the difference between variables, target lines and 
action lines is checking for '=', ':' and "    "(tab) respectively. However, an issue will 
arise in this method if the Makefile/Bakefile has a "=" in the action line, or maybe a "    
"(tab) in the variables line. 

We thought of a solution, however was not sure how to code that idea. Also we weren't sure 
if that idea actually works. We can distinguish the action lines from the other 2 by "    "
(tab), and to avoid the tabs in variable lines we make sure the first character is not a 
whitespace.

Can we get clarification on the idea or maybe advice on a more suitable method?

Thanks

Hello,

Yes, we've been helping a few students in labs this week who are having the same problems or confusion.  It stems 
from trying to take too many shortcuts when processing the input lines.  As you've seen, an action such as

  echo 1+1=2

shouldn't be confused with a variable definition, simply because it has an equals sign in it  (likely detected 
with strchr).

Take a big step backwards and review how to classify every line into one of the possible line types.  Using the 
help described here:

  https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help2002?p=np&a=243

we need to first expand any variables in every line, categorise each line, and then process each one based on its 
categorisation.

So we read and process the specification file with:

  while not end of file
    get the next full/continuation line
    expand any variables on that line

    categorise the expanded line:
      if it begins with '#', ignore this line and loop to read the next line

      if the line begins with a tab **and we've just processed a new target**, add this action to that target

      skip any leading spaces or tabs

      if we've reached the end of line, then the whole line was a blank line, so ignore it like a comment line

      now find the first 'word' on the line, collecting its characters until we find a space, tab, =, or :

      if we found '=', call   process_variable_definition(word, rest_of_line),  ideally in a different file

      if we found ':', call   process_target_definition(word, rest_of_line), ideally in a different file

      otherwise the line is unrecognised, print any error message and exit

  fclose file

Hi,
I was just wondering whether it is necessary to store the dependencies or their associated 
actions in a data structure?
At the moment my code is just reading the dependencies as they appear on the line and 
comparing their modification date to the target's modification date as it goes along - that 
then determines if the next line (assuming it's an action line) should be executed or not 
(also based on whether or not the user has specified a target to be built!). 

Is that an acceptable method?

Thanks.

I think i'm a little confused and would love some further clarification..

We are writing a Bake program - comprised of .c and .h files.

We are writing a Makefile consisting of the dependencies for our Bake program.

e.g. targetLine.o : targetLine.c variableDef.c etc. 
          rebuild targetLine.o

What is the bakefile? 

In my mind, Bakefile is the equivalent of Makefile, that our Bake program reads. Which is 
the specification file for some other program/s (not Bake's). How are we meant to write the 
Bakefile if thats the case? isn't it supposed to be varying? with different dependencies 
and such. Sorry for the confusion but I really need some clarification. I thought Bakefile 
would be the specification file for a random program that the marker's would make to test 
our Bake program.

Hoping that you've also read this:

  https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help2002?p=np&a=222

Yes, your Bakefile(s), just like Makefile(s) can specify the build instructions for any project.  We 
usually keep our projects in distinct directories, with one specific Makefile in that directory to 
build that project.

When your bake project is working (even nearly working) you'll be able to copy your project's source 
files, *.c and *.h, to another directory and use/test your bake program on itself:

    mkdir /tmp/testbake
    cp  *.c *.h Bakefile  /tmp/testbake
    ./bake -C /tmp/testbake

And, yes, we'll be testing your project submission on other random files
and projects, too,  but would love to see that it can build itself.

Thanks for the quick reply.

Just to make sure;
We are to be-able-to;

Bake aProgram (with URL dependencies) - this bakefile will be the marker's,
Make bake (Make to scan our 'Makefile' which has Bake's dependencies in it),
and in theory - bake bake.c (where 'Bakefile' is equivalent to the previous Makefile).

Provided that there our own Bakefile and Makefile, and a Marker's Bakefile/s; 
wouldn't our own Bakefile and Makefile be the same, just with different names. ie. our Bakefile == Makefile.

Sorry again for the confusion.

Hi,
I think I might have misunderstood/missed that part of the project. So if a : b c, and b has been modified more 
recently than a, then does b also need to be rebuilt if it has its own line, for example b: d e (regardless of 
the states of d and e)? I'm not exactly sure how this is meant to work in either Bake or makefiles.

I'm not quite sure what the phrase about dependencies "that identify other targets" (in the project specs) is 
meant to entail as I can't seem to see on the project specifications as to exactly what we are meant to do when 
that is the case.

Thank you for your help.

I'm afraid that I can barely understand what you're asking.

One question that I think you're asking, as are some other students, is why or how the people marking your project 
require both a Makefile and a Bakefile.  Yes, they can have identical contents, but they don't have to - for 
example, you may use automatic variables in your Makefile. Moreover, because they have different names, part of 
testing will ensure that your project finds the correct one.

On the issue/confusion that some students have about how the provision/requirement for a Bakefile will help the 
markers, consider the possible test:

    rm -f bake *.o
    cc ...... -o testbake *.c
    rm -f bake *.o

One of the reasons for setting this type of project, is so that students can get an 
understanding of both the use and working/implementation of a standard utility.  In this case, 
a strong understanding of how 'make' works can provide a lot of understanding about how it 
must (is probably) implemented.  A lot of source code has been freely provided in the unit's 
laboratories and workshops and, so, once you've understood what the project requires, a lot of 
the effort of developing and debugging (and even typing in) the code is simplified.

So you're able, and should, try to answer your own question.
Create your own Makefile which specifies the dependencies you've described in your question, 
and just run "make" to see what output it produces.

I just wanted clarification on comments in the project.

1. If a '#' is found mid line, we should not consider the rest of the line to be commented 
out?

Thank in advance

Your original question was (paraphrasing) "do I need to store dependencies and actions, or can I just execute things (if 
necessary) as soon as I read them?"

Consider the Makefile used in Friday's Workshop-8 :

_______
ALL     = list hashtable

C99     = cc -std=c99 -Wall -Werror -pedantic

all:    $(ALL)

list: list.c
        $(C99) -o list list.c

hashtable: hashtable.c
        $(C99) -o hashtable hashtable.c
______

The default target is 'all', and it has two dependencies of (the executable files) 'list' and 'hashtable'.
But neither 'list' or 'hashtable' initially exist (as files), so we can't determine if 'list' or 'hashtable' has been 
modified more recently than 'all', as we don't know what they are. Later in the file (once we read that far) we see that 
'list' is a target which also has dependencies,  and now we can determine whether 'list' needs rebuilding, and we can 
assign/determine list's modification date  (which we required for 'all').

You'll hopefully see that we *do* need to store dependencies and actions as "attributes" of a target, as we don't know 
which we'll need, and in what order, until we've finished reading the whole file, and knowing which targets we need to 
consider.

Try it in the standard utility 'make' to see what is performed, and in what order.
If still struggling with it, try an easy-to-understand tutorial on the standard "make", e.g.

Thanks I just wanted to clarify one other situation.
The first column is a hash and the last is a /
For example:
# foo /
bar

Will this become:
1.
# foo bar
2.
# foo /
bar

I am guessing from other answers it is case (1). 
Thanks

In the assignment description; 
"If any option is provided multiple times, only the last occurence of the option is used."

If say '-f' is called multiple times, 
ie. /bake -f file1 -f -f file2

Even though we are only to use the final file 'file2', should our program pick up that an 
argument hasn't been provided to the previous -f call? or should we only check this 
condition for the last occurence of -f? 

either way is doable however I just wanted to clarify, 
Thanks again.

I noticed in Make there are a few different ways to use variables and I wanted to confirm 
which things we need to include in our implementation - or perhaps all of them.

1. single letter variables
eg.
a = cc -std=c99

In this case, those variables can be referenced by:
$(a)
OR
$a

Do both need to be implemented in bake?

2. variables nesting
this is an example online but anything along these lines
x = y
y = z
a : $($(x))

Thanks in advance

I hadn't considered all of the possible ways in which people could provide erroneous options 
(or how to test for them all).

As the majority of people will be (wisely) using getopt() for their argument parsing, let's 
support what it supports.

In your example, above, getopt() will believe that the name of the required Bakefile is '-f' 
and that the required target is file2.  If both of those exist, then there'd be no error.

Hi I'm wondering if we should be ignoring blank spaces that are found inside of the bracket 
of a variable expansion.

For instance if we had 

TEST = this is a little paranoid

would we be able to access this variable using $( TEST) or $(TEST ) or would they be 
treated as a different variable e.g. | TEST|. Currently my code would remove any spaces in 
front of and after test.

Similarly in the case of the Special variables such as $(PID) could this be an acceptable 
use as well? $( PID) or $(PID )

I'm probably overthinking this but couldn't find an answer elsewhere on the forums so i 
apologise if this is a repeat question.

Thanks for any assistance rendered!

As you suggest - overthinking it.  What does make do with an action such as:

          echo aaa$( HOME )bbb
?


> Similarly in the case of the Special variables such as $(PID) could this be an acceptable

Similar result;  they're not even Special variables because the Special variables don't have spaces 
in their names.

I have a couple of questions regarding the project:
1.As shown in the last slide of lecture 12 will our bake program have to be able to 
read and utilise automatic variables.
2.Can we assume that only the action lines will begin with TAB and that no other types 
of lines will begin with tab
3.Can i also assume that all the dependencies in the Target lines be separated with a 
single space

Thank you for your time

In make the lines following \ are usually preceded by tabs, for the purpose of our bake

For example, Where (TAB) represents a tab and (SPACE) represents a space
Line1(SPACE)\
(TAB)(TAB)(SPACE(SPACE)Line2
Would produce
Line1(SPACE)(SPACE)(SPACE)Line2 
just like in make correct?

One final question is regarding whether or not Variable Definition lines Target Lines will

For example, where (space) = space and (tab) = tab
(space)(space)(space)NAME=VALUE
(space)(tab)(tab)(SPACE)targetname : [optional dependencies]

There's no need to assume that, but if it'll help you get past the problems you have with parsing 
the Bakefile then, yes, assume it.

No, and I'm unsure why it should be a big concern. Instead of code like:

    if(*ch == ' ') {
      ++ch;
    }

just write:

    while(*ch == ' ') {
      ++ch;
    }

I'm not aware that make (or other utilities) convert those tabs into spaces, but I'll encourage 
you not to worry about these finer points.  They are not going to be tested when marking your 
project.  Simply use the code that's been provided for you, and move on to the more systems-
focused parts of the project:

Simply let *any* line commence with zero-or-more spaces or tabs, other than Action lines which 
*must* begin with a tab.  This is described in the pseudo-code, here:

Hi,
I was just working through fixing this up and I was wondering what we should assume/do if (in your example) list (executable file) is 
not created by its actions? Should we set its modification date to the current time even if it is not a file on the disk? Thanks.

Also does our bake program have to comply with this? (from the link you posted)
"When a target is a filename, make compares the timestamps of the target file and its dependency files. If the dependency filename is another target 
in the Makefile, make then checks the timestamps of that target’s dependencies. It thus winds up recursively checking all the way down the 
dependency tree, to the source code files, to see if any of the files in the dependency tree are newer than their target filenames. (Of course, if 
the dependency files don’t exist, then make knows it must start executing the make targets from the “lowest” point in the dependency tree, to create 
them.)"

Thanks for your help.

If I have a loop and in this loop I wish to continue multiple times in a row, how should

Assuming if I don't skip until m = 12, condition A might run, but I don't want condition 
A to run until after m = 12.

I tried 

continue*12;

but it doesn't work...

Can I check if it is possible?

You replace the line:

with m = 11;

BUT, I hope this has nothing to do with the project, as those magic constants of 20 and 12 look

That quote provides one solution/mechanism to check and build dependencies, but it's not the only way to do it.
In particular, you do not have to build a dependency tree (a data structure), and we will not be testing with any examples that have loops in their 
dependencies.

I know this is minute but can variables be overridden, and can the key variables be 
overridden.

ie.

VAR1 = foo
VAR1 = bar

will $(VAR1) output foo or bar.

On the second point:

PID = foo
will $(PID) output the system call result or foo.

From: poster074@student.uwa.edu.au

Hi,

I was wondering if it is possible to modify a char pointer in another function by 
passing its pointer.

So for example, if I have:



void addLetter(char *word, char c) {
Add c to the end of *word
//also includes reallocation of memory.
}

void main() {
Char *word = “cit”;
addLetter(word, ‘s’);
print(%s, word)

//cits is printed out




However in the function addLetter, it duplicates the word(passed in the parameters). 
Is it possible to not duplicate the word and instead only make edits on the original 
pointer(the one in the main function)?

Thanks

The project description specified that dependencies can be 1 of 3 things: a file, an 
url or another dependency. 

In the case that a target is used as a dependency, does that mean that Bake should 
also build that target (going through its dependency and executing the actions if 
necessary); or does it mean that we need to know the time that the target was last 
run and use that to determine whether or not to execute the first target.

e.g.

```
targetA: file.c file2.c file3.c targetB
    action1
    action2

targetB: file4.c
    action3
    action4
```

bake targetA

Either
1. action 1-4 will be executed
2. depending on whether targetB has been "baked" more recently than the last time 
targetA was "baked", execute action1 and action2. Does this also mean that we need to 
store the last time each target was "baked" in the file system?

(this might depend on how you lookup you variables, but)
yes, you can set PID to foo,
but when you access $(PID) you should get its "official/special" value.

Yes, such a function is OK.

HOWEVER, the above is not OK.
The string constant "cit" is a CONSTANT - this is, it cannot be modified. The 
compiler will allocate exactly 4 bytes for it (3 + null-byte), so your attempt to 
append an 's' to it will not work as you shouldn't be able to modify/overwrite the 
null-byte.


> However in the function addLetter, it duplicates the word(passed in the

When you pass a pointer to a function, such as a pointer to a character (a string), 
the string is NOT duplicated in/for the function.  The functions see and, if not 
passed a pointer to read-only memory (such as a constant),  will be able to modify 
the caller's original data.

Perhaps a typo, but a dependency CANNOT be another dependency.
I think you meant 'target'.

If a dependency is another target, you need to check/determine if that target is up-to-date, and 
that may require that target to be rebuilt.


Try the following in make:

targetA: targetB
        @echo action1
        @echo action2

targetB:
        @echo action3
        @echo action4

Each invocation of make or bake is independent;  they do not leave any history/log behind in a 
file.  Each invocation determines what to do, and does it, each time.

No, your project won't be tested with any circular dependencies, so there's no need to 
detect them nor perform any modifications of the dependencies or actions to avoid them.

Hi Chris,

I have seen on some of the other posts that gettimeofday() is only necessary under certain 
implementations, and that it's purpose is to assign a time to which a target is built (in 
the case that the action's of that target to not produce a file with the same name as the 
target).  

I was wondering if it was safe to assume that if a dependency has been rebuilt, it has been 
modified more recently than the target.  In which case, we can use a boolean for whether 
the target has been rebuilt and not need to use gettimeofday().

I hope the question is clear.

Thanks

Your assumption is a safe one.
However, I'll admit to not having thought through whether a Boolean is sufficient to 
represent the build time (relationship), here - still trying to concoct a scenario where is 
may fail, because a single Boolean value effectively collapses all times to be the same.  If 
using gettimeofday (which is not difficult) at least the passing of time between successive 
calls may take several microseconds.

Great, thank you very much Chris.  

Yes, I too have spent quite a bit of time racking my brain trying to come up with an example 
where the Boolean will fail.  From my thinking, it seems reasonable to collapse the times, given 
that rebuilding a dependency will always lead to the target needing to be rebuilt - rendering the 
time that the dependency was rebuilt obsolete. 

The only scenario I could see that this would fail is if the target is created during the running 
of bake but before the target is rebuilt, meaning that it is created by the action lines of one 
of its dependency's.  And this seems counter-intuitive to the grouping of the action lines and so 
wouldn't take place in any self-respecting bakefile.  Let me know if you think of another 
scenario that this fails so that I can re-think my method.  

Thanks again.

I'm still a bit confused on how exactly dependancies that are themselves targets work. For 
example, the following bakefile should run the command "echo test2" followed by "echo 
test1" assuming only file3 exists if I'm understanding it correctly?

file1 : file2
    echo test1

file2 : file3
    echo test2


Should the following bakefile also have the same result even though the order of the target 
lines are different or would only "echo test2" be run?

file2 : file3
    echo test2

file1 : file2
    echo test1

I'm assuming here that you're running  ./bake file1
in both cases.

The physical order of the targets in a Bakefile does not matter and, in your second example, 
target file1 is dependent on the earlier target file2.  As each target can only be defined once in 
each Bakefile, it doesn't matter whether you search forwards or backwards for them.

(but, did you try your own examples with  make ?)

So, in addition to printing out the error, should we print a list describing the usage of bake (as with Make) and 
terminate the program, or continue execution with the default bakefile if present?

Certainly report an error, printing out a list of possible options (a 'usage' message) is considered good practice, and 
exit.  DO NOT continue with any default or assumed actions - it's a bad practice for a program to try to outguess the user 
as to 'what they really wanted'.

Report error and terminate.
It's extremely unlikely your program will be *able* to proceed without the memory it requested!

If excel() fails it's because it couldn't find or run the requested program.

You'll know it has failed because the excel() function will actually return to your code - 
normally, on success, the function does not return.

Rather stumped by this one, as I've never seen fork() fail due to a shortage of 
memory.  The manual entry for fork() states that the only way an ENOMEM error code 
is returned is if there's a shortage of swap space  (not a shortage of RAM).  Are 
you possibly running this on your personal machine, which has a very, very full 
disk?

I'm surprised that you can reduce your known memory requirements so easily.
Are you using (large) fixed sized arrays for your program's variables, rather 
than allocating (the minimum) dynamic memory?

Let's say bake is run with the invocation -i indicating that all errors in action files are 
ignored.

How should this be indicated to the user?

Should we go the make way and print something along the lines of "make: [file1] Error 1 
(ignored)" or should we not mention the error and suppress it instead with "2>/dev/null"?

Dear Chris,

Could you tell me the breakdown of the marks for the assignment?
Some parts like URL dependencies are too difficult to be done. My teammate and I are 
going to focus more on how to produce object files and executable given the 
bakefile.
Thanks!

I don't believe that this (amount of memory) is the reason for your problems with 
fork(), and don't believe that your attempted fix will fix it.

In the grand scheme of things, 8000+ bytes is *tiny* in comparison to the amount 
of memory your process(es) will be using.  If this amount were the problem, you'd 
see that a malloc request of, say, 100000 bytes would fail, but I imagine that 
that still works.

Moreover, you haven't stated how your changed the value from 8192 to 50, but if 
you meant BUFSIZ rather than bufsiz, and if you changed it by editing the stdio.h 
header file, then that's a VERY dangerous practice.  Changing the constant will 
change the size of your own variables that use it, but will not change/reduce the 
size of variables already compiled into the standard libraries.

The former, similar to make, seems best.

As the project sheet states, 40 of the possible 60 marks will come from the correctness 
of your solution.  The code for processing the URL  (ignoring the code to fork and exec 
curl, itself, because it's identical that for bash) is fewer than 20 lines long,  and 
will be worth 4 or fewer marks of that 40.

I'm more concerned, however, about your statement "focus more on how to produce object 
files and executable".  Your project does not need to explicitly build any object files 
or executables - bake knows nothing about the compilation process.  Every action line 
(which may have nothing to do with compilation) is simply executed by the shell,  so 
there's nothing you need to specifically do to produce specific files.

I changed it by defining bufsiz in my program
I also managed to solve my memory problems 
turns out one of my functions was using malloc 
and was being run a large amount of times but 
i didnt free the allocated space so after 
being run several times it used all the memory 
and couldnt be forked

Glad that you've found the problem.

(now I wonder if using vfork(), instead, would have worked)

Over the past couple of days I've received a number of requests for individual 
extensions for the project.  For about 4 years now, unit coordinators are not permitted 
to offer such extensions - requests must be made through your Faculty Student Office, 
and they'll inform the coordinator of the outcome.  It's a fairer process, removes bias 
in the decision making, and all of your unit coordinators are informed.  If making a 
request, ensure that you clearly explain/provide your reasons for the request, such as 
by taking a medical certificate.  Be aware, however, that being busy with other 
assessments in other units, or being busy in paid employment is not considered as 
grounds for an extension, and you may consider the 10%-per-day late penalty a better 
option if needing a bit more time.

Good luck,

Could you please tell me if my understanding of this project is correct? The main goal of 
this project would be to sort the text file(such as replacing $(C99) with the definition C99     
=  cc -std=c99) and then execute them in the shell to produce an executable file?

NO.  Your understand is far from correct.

Not sure I quite understand the question.
However, you won't need to use execvp(),  but should be using execl().
There is no program named 'exit';  the standard shells are able execute 'exit' because they 
call the exit() function, internally, to exit the shell itself.

(I also don't understand the title of this thread).

For each of macOS or Linux, do not stipulate which compiler you want - just invoke 'cc'.

Hello, just a couple questions about the submission requirements.

First of all when it says you must submit all header files, do you mean all the 
headers we used including stdlib.h etc.?

Secondly, the submission requirements mentions a Bakefile and a Makefile that 
"specify the steps required to compile and link your project". Would it be possible 
for you to elaborate on this? I'm a little bit confused, especially about the fact 
that we require a Makefile when we are programming for use with Bakefiles.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: Segmentation Fault error with mktime()
From: poster060@student.uwa.edu.au
X-smilie: none
X-img: none
X-anonymous: yes

When doing the url dependencies I return the value of the function that gets the
time of when the url was last modified as a struct tm.
Following this i throw it straight into mktime() which immediately causes a
segmentation Fault.
I know this because I've printed out random words immediately before and after
mktime() and the words after mktime() aren't being printed.
So at first I thought the issue was something like maybe the memory for struct tm
was too small. After messing around with it I've figured that this isn't actually
the problem. 
So I thought maybe the way it's storing the values is wrong however when i use
strftime() immediately before mktime() the result printed out right before mktime()
was what was expected with no faults whatsoever.
I also read online that you might need to set struct tm's tm_isdst manually when you
use the strptime() function to save your string into a struct tm so i went to
manually set it to 0 and printed it out ensuring that the value was properly set
however the problem was still occuring.
HOWEVER the strangest part is when I run my code and there is only 1 url dependency
everything works perfectly fine. There are also other abnormalities. 

For example when i have 2 url dependencies that are both the exact same url
(5min/5min url test) the output in terminal when running the program is the following.
The inital part is just some terminal output from runnning curl
where urldate is the urldate pulled from the file
buffer is the date processed by strftime from the stuct tm
pre/postfail is text i print before and after i run mktime()

As you can see the first url works completely fine while the second just causes
errors. When i run a bakefile with only one url everything works completely fine as
well. The only conclusion I could come to was that maybe my struct tm wasn't
initializing properly but even when I set all the values in struct tm to 0 and than
ran strptime() the error still occured. So at this point I actually have no idea
what's going on.


So I started getting desperate and tried random things like changing the bakefile to
have two different url tests for example:
When the two url dependencies are (20min/5 min url test) the output is this

As you can see the error is completely different now, So I believe there is
something going on with mktime();
Just for reference i've tried two different methods of inputting into mktime();
First one is:
struct tm url = returnFromFunction;
mktime(&url);

Second is
struc tm url = returnFromFunction;
struct tm * urlptr = &url;
mktime(&url);

So yeah as you can see i've done extensive debugging and still have no idea what's
going on so I'd really appreciate the help. Sorry for the long post.

perror() works correctly when reporting errors detected with calls to standard library 
functions or system calls.  It cannot be used to print your own custom messages.

No penalties for longer lines, but readability is essential
(no penalties for anything - you earn marks, you don't have them taken away).

I understand why you're asking the question but, as for strdup() on Linux, I find it much 
easier to just declare it:

   extern FILE *fdopen(int fd, char *mode);


(there's also differing claims to its ownership - XOPEN or POSIX).

 From your description of the problem, alone, I can't diagnose the problem, but it's extremely unlikely that you've stumbled on a bug in mktime(), given the 
billions of times it's used by others, worldwide, everyday.  The problem is almost certainly elsewhere in your program.

At this late stage it's not going to give much away, but I've written a bit of code:

    else if(strncasecmp(line, "last-modified:", 14) == 0) {
	struct tm tm;

	printf("%s\n", line);
	if(strptime(line+20, TIME_FORMAT_STRING, &tm) != NULL) {
	    result      = mktime(&tm);
	    printf("\ttime_t %i\n", (int)result);
	    printf("\tlocal %s", ctime(&result));
	}
    }

and call it hundreds of times in a standalone program;
it keeps printing, without failing on either macOS and Linux:

Both of these are 'identical' to my code, above, though you're not actually using your  urlptr.

That means both are identical except names of the files?
I just do Copy and Paste my Makefile and then Rename it to Bakefile.

Should we expect to be tested "Makefile/Bakefile" that is different from the 
Makefiles in Lecture12 p.12,13,14?
What I meant by different is "a comment line within the same line as variable, 
target or command lines" instead of above or below this lines or on a separate line.
This is the only variation that I can think of.
or
Should we be fine if we can do the followings?
1. variable substitutions
2. memory allocations
3. curling urls
4. modification time comparisons

e.g 
# A Makefile to build our 'calcmarks' project

PROJECT =  calcmarks #name of the project, run this by: ./calcmarks RESULT.txt
HEADERS =  $(PROJECT).h #this is a header
OBJ     =  calcmarks.o globals.o readmarks.o correlation.o #object files

No, because the submission system does not know that the submission is from a group  
(and only your comment in source code files declares that).

I suggest that the person submitting the project prints, or saves to PDF, the page 
providing the receipt, and sends it with their project partner.

Unsure if you think the Makefiles from those lecture pages 'span' all possible things.
Your project will certainly be tested on a number of different Bakefiles, which will 
hopefully demonstrate what works, and what may not.

I just have a couple of quick questions about the project arguments.
First is how should our program react when the input is both -s and -n as they're
conflicting arguments, as one of them is print executing commands but don't execute
them, whilst the other is execute commands and don't print.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Second is the interaction between -n and @ action lines, in this case I'm assuming
that -n should take priority and the @ action lines are still printed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Third is will we need to code for "multi level" dependencies. For example
PrimaryTarget : D1 D2 D3
D3 : D5 D6
D2: D3 D4 D5
D5 : D6
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fourth, I'm just wondering if it's fine that when I'm running -s if it's fine for my
program when using execl to grab the header files for url it's okay to print out the
output of the command to the terminal as I'm not sure how to stop it from printing
in the terminal.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fifth I have an error check for testing whether or not we fail to pull the header
information from the url, and was wondering how it would interact with -i. As if we
fail to get the headerfile we won't be able to determine whether or not the
actionLine needs to be run in the first place. So should the program just terminate.
In general should -i only allow errors for action Lines but not allow errors for
anything else.

I wanted to clarify exactly how our program should treat the -C [directory path] option. 
I'm not sure to what extent we are supposed to be changing directory based on other answers 
in the help forum (that i found anyway). 

Are we supposed to a):
read bakefile or a file specified by -f [file name] and then continue the rest of our 
program from the original directory

or b):
treat the directory from the -C option as our working directory for the rest of execution, 
specifically looking for dependencies in that directory.

My current implementation of the command line has the program look for dependency files in 
the directory specified by the -C option and as such it will not work if we are supposed to 
still look for dependencies in the directory we started from.

Sorry if this question has been asked but I couldn't figure out what was supposed to happen 
in regards to this command line option otherwise.

Thanks for your time!

./bake -C randomdir    -C 
or
./bake -f randomfile   -f 
should we use the randomdir/randomfile or do we just "use"the second one where it'll default to the default filename bakefile/Bakefile and not change directory

Hi,

In the assignment brief under 'Variable definitions', it describes the use of special 
variable expansions. One of which is $(PWD), which uses the function getcwd() 
formatted as a string to replace the variable. I am just wondering whether this use of  
$(PWD) is a spelling mistake and it is meant to be $(CWD), i.e. the abbreviation for 
Current Working Directory, or is it meant to be the abbreviation for Process's Working 
Directory (PWD).

The -n option still performs everything 'normally', it simply does not execute the action lines.
The -s option suppresses the printing of the actions before they are executed.
With just -n, the actions are still printed.
With both -n and -s, the actionsa re not printed.

Same mechanism as above;  @ simply requests 'silence' from a single action.

Re-read the manual entry for curl to learn how to capture its output into a file.

The -i option only ignores the exit status of actions, so this answer applies:

It is not a typo.

You'll find that your shell manages an environment variable named $PWD
and there's an on-disk command  /bin/pwd
historically standing for 'print' or 'present' working directory.

Read the file line by line.

Use an int variable called count to count the number of colons.

For each line, iterate through each char (preferably using a char pointer) and every time you find 
a ':' increase count by one.

Then just return the value of count when all lines in your file have been read.

I am assuming you want something just to "get rid" of the white spaces, before the first 
word in a line.

You can use something like this:

   while(isspace(*ch) == " "){
       ch++;
   }

As soon as the while loop breaks you are at the first char in the line and then you can do 
whatever you intend to.

I suggest that you change this to:

     while(isspace(*ch)) {
         ch++
     }

as isspace() is only defined to return 0 or non-zero, not the character it matches.

Hi,

Is our program supposed to remove "./" when invoking bake, so instead of calling 
"./bake" , user will have to call it with "bake"?

There was a way which involves modifying the .profile file in the user's Home 
directory but i don't think this is what the projects wants.

Does anyone have any ideas?

Thank You!

while you are waiting for a direct answer it might be helpful...

you'll see something like this below if you use getopt()
 
line1: prompt> ./bake -C
Line2: ./bake: option requires an argument -- 'C'
Line3: Usage: ./bake [-C directoryname] [-f filename] [-i] [-n] [-p] [-s]

Just support a single file provided by the -f option.
If -f is provided multiple times, just process the last file presented:

   ./bake -f file1 -f file2

would just process the spec in file2.

Just requesting clarification on the line "If no value of NAME can be found anywhere, 
the empty string is 'inserted' at the current point."

Is this suggesting that we remove any variable that can't be found? As in, "$(C99) 
$(CFLAGS) -o $(PROJECT) $(FOO) -lm" should become "$(C99) $(CFLAGS) -o $(PROJECT) -lm" 
if FOO is not found to be either a provided or environmental variable?

This issue is not part of the project, and you do not have to address it.

You can invoke a program sitting in your current directory, without the preceding ./ by 
having the current directory in your shell's PATH variable:

  prompt>  export PATH="$PATH:."

Referring to the project description...
Similar to make, our program bake will read the specification of a project's dependencies from a line-
oriented textfile. By default, bake will first attempt to open the file Bakefile or (if unsuccessful) the 
file bakefile from the current working directory. Sequences of characters on each line that are separated 
by one or more space or tab characters are termed words and are used to identify targets and dependencies 
(see later).

Shouldn't the highlighted ***Makefile*** in the image suppose to be Bakefile/bakefile?

Thank you.

Hi, 

I am a little confused on how exactly to handle URL dependencies. Are we supposed to 
rebuild *all* targets that have a URL dependency that is newer than it (even though the URL 
doesn't appear in the action line), or should we just print a message stating that the URL 
is newer? 

Thanks in advance!

It could be, but I was only making a general statement about software project development, not something specific 
to the project that you have to worry about.

There's nothing special about URLs as dependencies.
Dependencies are each one of: a file, a target, or a URL,
and each has a special/different way to find its modification time.

Independent of the what the dependencies are, we only build the minimum number of targets to 
complete what bake is asked to do (either a specific target or the default/first one).

If a URL can't be found or doesn't provide a Last-Modified line, then it's the same error condition 
as if a required target couldn't be found.

So, for example, if we had a 'bake' file with the following:

bake : bake.o bake1.o bake2.o
    cc -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -Werror -o bake.o bake1.o bake2.o

bake.o : bake.c $(URL)
    cc -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -Werror -c bake.c

and the $(URL) was to a header-file but was newer than the target, would we rebuild both bake and bake.o?

Sorry, just trying to get my head around it all...

YES, it's exactly the same as if you had that header-file on your local disk,
but we're using curl to find its modification time, rather than stat().

Our program searches only Bakefile/bakefile without specifying -f option:

Not sure if it is a redundant question. 
Do I get it right in all the following description? This is how I understood recently. 

prompt>./bake //searches only Bakefile/bakefile by default in the same director

prompt>./bake -C [directory] //searches only Bakefile/bakefile by default in the specified [directory]

This might be a weird question. But will we be expected to handle any other urls 
besides those that have the http protocol (so maybe https), since curl only issues a 
HEAD request for that? Just wanted to make sure we're not leaving anything out.

Yes, from the current directory in which bake was invoked.

Change the process's current working directory, and continue as with your first example.
The directory name is not optional.

 
> prompt>./bake -f [target] //target can be Bakefile/bakefile/Makefile/makefile/"any file" in the same directory

NO.
You need to invoke:     ./bake -f filename  [target]
The optional target is a target-name that must be found in the indicated file.


> prompt>./bake -C [directory] -f [target] //target can be Bakefile/bakefile/Makefile/makefile/"any file" in the 
> specified [directory]

The command  ./bake -C directoryname -f filename

first changes to the requested directory, and then reads from filename in the new directory.

Why not - I (politely) can't understand why you're asking the question.

If you expand the variables on each line as soon as you read the line from the file,
the two cases are identical  (aren't they?)

getopt() doesn't perform any magic, it only helps you out in parsing the arguments.
It will report failure if the provided arguments do not match the pattern passed as a parameter to getopt().
For example,  if you run bake as   ./bake -f
but without a filename following, getopt() will detect this, and inform your code about the problem,
but it doesn't report/print any message about the missing filename.

Similarly, our project should only accept zero-or-more targets on the command-line so, if two are given, then your code 
- not getopt() - needs to detect that and report the problem.

Hi Chris,

When we run our bakefile through our project, we sporadically get an Abort Trap : 6 error, 
about 1 every 10 runs.

Is this a problem that we should worry about and fix?

Also, when using calloc for an array of strings (pointer to a pointer **), how much space 
do we allocate to the outer calloc() and the inner calloc()?

Thanks.

Yes, needs to be fixed.
Very likely a memory allocation error.

Perhaps a misunderstanding of this is leading to your error?
You need to allocate  (N * sizeof(char *)) bytes for your vector of pointers,
and then use strdup() to allocate space for, and clone/duplicate into, each string you're vector 
will be pointing to.

Hi Chris, 

You mentioned when a url can't be found it's the same error condition as a target could be found. So 
should it stop?

However, in the project it is stated to ignore the target. So leave the target out?

Not necessarily;  if the 'other target' does not need rebuilding, then (with respect to 
*that* dependency) A does not need rebuilding and, thus, its actions are not executed.

At this late stage, assuming that you've already adopted the Github code and it's 
"locked in" to your project, I feel I have to say yes.


______
BUT, I seriously question why you'd come to this decision:

- code to store the names and values in a simple 'vector of structures' approach, 
as promoted in our lectures and workshops (our concordance exercise), has all but 
been provided. 

- a typical Makefile or Bakefile will have fewer than 10 variable definitions, so 
storing the names and values in a hashtable, rather than a simple vector, will 
use hundreds (thousands?) of times more memory for just a handful of elements.

- and if you wanted a hashtable, with code simple enough to understand, a good 
example was provided in our last workshop.

Using getopt(), as strongly encouraged, provides great support for concatenated 
options.  Use getopt() and the difficulty in your question disappears.

However, unsure if this demonstrates some confusion, but your example

  bake -C -f -s directoryname filename

will not work as you may expect, as the '-f' will be assumed to be the name of 
the directory for the '-C' option.

If a URL is not found, just as if a target is not found, print an error and exit (as does make).

The project description states that if a URL does not exist, then you should not try to find that same 
URL as a target.  URLs are only ever dependencies, and are never targets.

Dear Lovely Student,

Have a look at Q3 of Labsheet-5:

  http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/labsheets/labsheet5-solns.php

(I'm unsure what you mean by 'My program can generate the .o file', as bake doesn't need to 
know anything about the actions that it asks bash to execute).

Hi all,

It might be a bit late but we've come at an impasse for ignoring the warnings and 
errors for the invocation -i or modifier '-'. Currently we are: 

1. forking the action, and executing the action in the child process.

2. Then we use WEXITSTATUS and WIFEXITED to try and catch any of the errors.

3. Either exiting with success or failure, but our problem is that it still prints 
the errors for such as compiling problems in a dependency and if my understanding is 
correct, this should not be printed.

We are now not sure about this. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Capturing the exit status of bash (which will be the exit status of the action that 
bash tried to execute)?

The -i option does not require you to suppress any error output (as that is very 
helpful).  The -i option just asks bake to treat any 'failed' actions as if they 
succeeded.

That is right, we are running bash in the child process. Aaah I see, so we were looking at this 
the wrong way.

While you are waiting for direct answer you can get some idea from this link:
http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?method=document&id=up15/5

**********************************************
10.2.4 The following consequences of late or non-submission must be made clear to 
students:

 

a) a penalty of 10 per cent of the possible mark allocated for the assessment item is 
deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays), after 
which the assigned work is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the 
assignment is due. For example, a student, who has submitted a piece of work for an 
assessment item late by three days and was scored a mark of 45 out of a possible mark of 
50, receives after penalty a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day as a 
penalty for each student from the mark obtained). Where there are a number of tasks within 
an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied holistically to the assessment item 
after all tasks have been completed.

b) where assignments are graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may 
result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the 
semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course 
or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course; and

c) assessments submitted later than 7 days after the deadline receive a mark of zero, 
unless an application for mitigation is approved in accordance with the University Policy 
on Assessment: Special Consideration (UP11/23).

The reason is 
What is that "haversine"? 

If you already have that "haversine/haversine.exe" then the error might be due to 
this line which you don't see.

Hello Angus,

(left my reply until the dust had settled from the project)

That's an interesting observation but, I'm afraid that I don't see the connection.

Do you think it's because the specification file presents its format in a structured 
way, using some indentation, rather than using something like Microsoft's 
traditional .ini format (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file) ?

Historically, the use of structured specification files bordering on their use as 
very specific programming languages is attributed to a number of older Unix tools.

book "The Art of Unix Programming", by Eric Steven Raymond.

I've decided to take a 10% hit handing in my assignment a day late as I feel my overall 
mark would be better if I completed the assignment properly. severely underestimated it -

I'm having trouble with how to manipulate strings, ie. inputing the value where $(VAR) is.

if the following logic is incorrect please let me know;
- find the position of '$(',
- copy that string into another with strdup()
- find position of the next ')',
- copy that string into another with strdup(),
- then realloc() with the original length + the difference between the $(VAR) and VALUE 
lengths?
- not sure how or where in the code to seperate the 3 strings. beginning-value-end.

basically I can't figure out how to change only part of a string ie. from index 8 onwards, 
or how to capture only part of a string. i know there are functions like strtok or strstr 
but surely there is a simpler way that i'm just blind to seeing.

I know a specific answer probably isn't allowed but if anyone can point me in a direction 
to lab/lecture slides or something. I can't find anything exactly addressing it on 
stackoverflow etc. 

Thanks either way,

a very silly student.

On the project page, it seems to indicate that lines declaring targets with no

Is that what we're meant to do, seeing that make itself ignores such lines?

I'm not going to claim this is the best way to do it, or even a *good* way to do it, but I used a 
combination of a new static char that's far larger than it needs to be, strncpy, and sprintf. Find 
the index of the variable using strstr, copy the first (var_index-old_line) characters from old 
line to the new line using strncpy, null terminate the new string, then construct it all using 
sprintf. 

I think that's how it works, anyway. It's far from perfect, but hopefully that keeps you going with 
the project!

You've likely submitted your project by now, but don't forget that strings are (can also be accessed 
as) arrays of characters, so you can to just part of a string, between "$(" and ")", character-by-
character by accessing each array index.  Copy the required characters into another array, terminate 
that with a null-byte, and you can then use that as a string to find it in your list of variables.

Don't forget that a variable's name might be much shorter than its value, so you won't be able to just 
replace it in-situ.

Good luck,

make doesn't ignore targets with no dependencies.
Consider the target named 'clean' here:

  http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/lectures/lecture12/14.html

Executing 'make clean' will *always* run the target's action, because there's no file named 
'clean' in the current directory   (make calls these phony targets).

Executing a target's actions depends on that target's dependencies (if any), not whether or not 
it's an existing file.  See:

  https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help2002?p=np&a=442

A target's actions may not always create a file with the target's name, so you may find it 
easier to think of things as a 'rebuild time' rather than a modification times.

If we were dealing with unsigned integers, integers which cannot be negative, then
you would be correct in the case of 3 bit sized unsigned ints. So for a 1 byte
unsigned it:

~1 => 254  which is:  ~00000001 => 11111110

However, in this case, we are talking about singed int's, so they can be negative.
The way this information is almost always stored is in the most significant bit (the
left most in this layout). So since that one will be flipped too, it becomes a
negative, and then it is not as simple as 0xxxxxxx = - 1xxxxxxx, e.g 10000001 != -1,
rather it equals -127. This is because it basically starts count up from the
smallest negative.

So in signed:

~1 => -2   which is the same as before, bitwise: ~00000001 => 11111110

No (not 8); I don't think such questions are very good at discriminating a student's 
knowledge - a point that is listed as an advantage for one mechanism can often simply be 
listed as a disadvantage for the other mechanism.  Also, requiring a nice even number of 
mirrored adv/disadv suggests that each mechanisms is equal in value.

Both mechanisms hold some (common) advantages over a system that used neither mechanism, 
and each mechanism has advantage(s) over the other mechanism. You may not get to 8, but 
there's enough to write about.  But focus on the adv/disadv,  not waste time and space 
describing how each mechanism works.

Are we allowed to use pseudocode for code related questions in Exams? Would this result in 
any penalties?

For example, to loop through each file in a dir, can we do something like:

while((dp = readdir(dirp)) != NULL) {
    if(dp is a file) {
        // code here for files
    } else if(dp is a dir) {
        // code here for dirs
    }
}

As a last resort, if you cannot remember the far better actual code/functions required.

There are no 'penalties' in exam marking. Your mark starts at zero, and is increased for everything 
that you state/describe correctly.  There are no negative marks.

The marking of the projects by manual inspection (looking at programming style and good 
practices for this project, providing 20/60 marks has been completed).  However, attempts 
to automate most of the tests, to see which parts of your projects work successfully 
(providing 40/60 of the marks), have proved too difficult (or error prone), and they're 
mostly being checked "by hand".  So, you won't be getting your project marks back today,  
but will some time over the weekend.

[ Why has the automated testing proved more difficult than hoped, and what sort of things 
really slow down the marking?

We've received 168 project submissions, 68 from individuals, 100 from pairs.
Of those, 22 clearly look like they have never compiled+linked successfully, and no 
(reasonable) amount of editing can get them to compile;  18 submissions were missing 
critical files (typically 1 or 2), and students were emailed to provide the files; 28 
submissions required some (limited) editing/modification to just get them to compile; 25 
submissions did not include the required Makefile (or even a Makefile.txt) to compile them; 
15 submissions incorrectly required their Bakefiles to have a .txt extension.  All of these 
problems need addressing even before a project can be run against even basic tests.

And, sadly, 21 students' submissions have been referred to the Faculty's Academic Conduct 
advisor for excessive collaboration, plagiarism, or contract cheating. ]

No one has been bothered to fill it in. lol
everyone's too lazy. The 2016 one was a collaboration from last year and was already filled in.

Hi there

Quick question in regard to the theory questions for the exam. These questions seem to fall 
around 5 marks so I want go gauge a view of how in depth we should be going as it is 
important for time management. 

If my answer to one of these questions contains a lot of technical jargon, should I then 
explain what each technical word means or assume that you already know what it means? I.E 
Should I write my answer on the assumption that I'm answering to someone who has a 
background in these areas already or on the assumption that the reader has no background?  

Cheers

Further to this question, for questions falling along the lines of "discuss the advantages and

topic before talking about the pros and cons?

It may not be of help to your question but Chris covered some past exam questions in the last lecture 
where he said that they do not mark questions extremely rigorously. Where if what you are saying is 
relevant and not incorrect, you will most likely gain full/majority of the marks. I'm sure there are key 
points they will want you to cover however. 

Don't know if this helped at all but the latest lecture should give you an idea. Otherwise wait Chris's 
direct response. :)

With your answer you're explaining to a knowledgable marker what you know.
You will be awarded marks for how well (correctly, clearly, unambiguously) you address the question. 

You are not being asked to provide a basic tutorial-style introduction to a person unfamiliar to an 
area;  you are not being awarded marks for how ell you educate that person in the material for the 
first time.

However, I think I can see why you're asking your question, the "a lot of jargon" part (let's call 
them 'terms' :-)

You should use the correct technical terms to demonstrate your understanding of a topic, but it's 
important to place them in a context, so that you're not just 'name dropping' to make your answer 
appear knowledgable.

(I see the above point, a lot, in the Computer Networks unit which employs lots of acronyms to 
succinctly describe technical concepts;  too often in exams students use the acronyms as a form of 
'name dropping', often evident when the wrong acronym is used).

Does that help?

The above response is the correct one :-)

Based on current progress, I honestly doubt it.
However, your main goal should really be to attempt tomorrow's exam as well as you can, not 
to focus on how many marks you may need to pass overall (because, in practice, students are 
very bad at assessing their own exam performance during, or immediately after, an exam).

Good luck,

In the 2017 exam student solutions he showed us in week 12, the 2 examples that the student 
provide were(kinda) 2 of the dot point (1 and 3) mentioned in Lecture 14 page 1 slide.

--> Except for infrequent branches and function/procedure invocation, program execution is 
sequential. The next instruction to be fetched usually follows the last one executed.

--> Programs generally operate at the same "depth" of function-invocation. References to 
instructions cluster within (and between) a small collection of functions.

--> Most iterative control flow (looping) is over short instruction sequences. Instructions 
from the same memory locations are fetched several times in succession.

--> Access to memory locations holding data is, too, constrained to a few frequently required 
data structures, or sequential steps through memory (e.g. when traversing arrays)

And the student got 4/5 marks for this questions, so I assume he's on the right track?

 From what I know, virtual memory is used to swap out unused programs from the main

through virtual memory that this is possible, or have I understood this wrong?

Hi Chris,

Apart from the questions that asks for an explanation using the aid of diagrams, can 
we use diagrams to enhance our explanations for other "non-diagram-related" 
questions?

An example would be Virtual Memory and how it appears to support the use of more 
memory than a computer has. With assistance diagrams, we can explain how the memory 
is stored in virtual memory.

(Maybe I should rephrase my question better. Are our diagrams used in "non-diagram-
related" questions going to be considered and marked as part of our written answer? 
Or will it be ignored and only the written part is read?)

Thanks

Yes, you may use/add diagrams to your answer to support your answers.

However, may sure that you refer to the diagrams, possibly labelling and referring to its parts,
else it just looks like you've provided a diagram without any context (like name-dropping).

That test was tough. It was actually tough, and you should be proud of yourself for 
getting through. A lot of the questions were taken from previous exams in this unit, 
but even with access to them, this was still a difficult exam.

The average mark last year was 33.5/60. 56%. That means a lot of people struggled 
then, too. More than anything, I'm taking that as reassurance. Don't rely on scaling, 
but try not to let your results stress you out, either. Because there's no way that 
almost half last year's cohort failed the unit, right, Chris? Right?

An enormous thanks to whoever created that Google Doc. You saved my hide, and the 
hides of all eighty other people online at midnight last night.

Best of luck in all your upcoming exams!

Thanks Jason.

The marking of the project is being reviewed (and not as quickly as I understand students would prefer), more 
out of necessity than generosity.

The part being reviewed is the testing of the compiled programs (/40). The first 4 marks are awarded based on 
whether the submissions would compile and link cleanly (no warnings), 4/4,  or if they required a small amount 
of editing to get them to compile.

But based on the other 20 tests, each time executing the compiled program in a new empty directory, the 
average mark, so far, is only a bit over 11 / 36.
___
x / 4      Compiles and links successfully, without warnings, no changes required
x / 2      Test 1 - reports an error if either Bakefile or bakefile does not exist
x / 2      Test 2 - reports an error if Bakefile contains just plain text
x / 2      Test 3 - a basic Bakefile, 1 target, 0 dependencies, 1 successful action
x / 2      Test 4 - target does not exist, 0 dependencies, 2 successful actions
x / 2      Test 5 - target does not exist, 0 dependencies, actions are: success,fail,success
x / 2      Test 6 - target does not exist, existing dependency, 1 action
x / 2      Test 7 - target does not exist, 2 existing dependency, 1 action
x / 2      Test 8 - new target, 1 older dependency, 1 action
x / 2      Test 9 - request a target that does not appear in Bakefile
x / 2      Test 10 - request the second target that exists in Bakefile
x / 2      Test 11 - request default target that builds a second target
x / 1      Test 12 - defines 1 variable, but does not later expand it
x / 1      Test 13 - defines 1 variable, expands it later
x / 1      Test 14 - defines 2 variables, expands both of them
x / 1      Test 15 - expands the 4 builtin variables: PID, PPID, PWD, and RAND
x / 2      Test 16 - the -C command-line option (change directory before reading Bakefile)
x / 2      Test 17 - the -f command-line option (read specifications from indicated filename)
x / 2      Test 18 - the -p command-line option (print internal representation of specifications)
x / 2      Test 19 - a dependency is a URL, which forces rebuilding target
x / 2      Test 20 - a dependency is a URL, which does not force rebuilding target

So I've been looking for any systemic errors or misunderstandings that have 'prevented' many submissions from 
receiving any marks from about Test 4.  So far, the only systemic problem appears to be that many submissions 
have made no use of the sample code and sample solutions provided in lectures, labsheets, workshops, and 
help2002,  and the reinvention-of-the-wheel has introduced many errors that, clearly, students have spent much 
time trying to correct (and, thus, not progressing through the project's requirements).

On that, I'm quite stumped.

I have "finished" marking them,  but they still require more curation.

The average that I need to report at a Faculty meeting is 22.1/60,  which is 
disappointingly low.  From that total I can remove the 38 students who did not submit a 
project, at all, but are still enrolled (and some sat the final exam).  That lifts the 
average to 27.6/60.  Still too low, and will be reduced even more if only half the
22 students referred to the Faculty's Academic Conduct Advisor receive 0/60.

I'm currently looking at some (40+) that have failed many of the tests because their 
programs terminate in the same way, many times - looking for errors that make them fail 
once, but then result in all tests receiving zero.

I'm confident that by tonight I will have had enough of this, and will release the marks as 
they stand, but may debug and change a few more before my (secret) deadline.

I don't mean to be rude, but, do you NEED
to know your marks right now? You're on 
holiday, enjoy it. I mean, I get it, I 
would like to know my marks too but I am 
quite happy to relax confident in the 
fact that Chris is working on it to the 
best of his abilities. I only say this 
because I have noticed people hounding 
the lecturer for marks in one of my other 
units as well, and it's just annoying at 
this point. Also, I think Chris's 
previously reply provided sufficient 
insight into how far along the marking 
process is. Perhaps read it again. At 
least you are polite about it though.

Your project marks and feedback sheets are now available via csmarks.
The average of all 143 submitted, compilable, and testable projects is a 
disappointingly low 28.1 / 60.

Firstly, congratulations to the 33 students receiving 45 or higher for the project.  
Obviously a job well done, and they were a pleasure to mark.

All submissions have received some marks (average of 12.2 /20) for programming 
style, including your use of meaningful comments, well chosen identifier names, 
appropriate choice of basic data-structures and data-types, appropriate choice of 
control-flow constructs, and isolation of distinct responsibilities in separate 
source files.

Up to 4 marks have been awarded for submitting a project which simply compiled and 
linked correctly (free marks for a 2nd year unit!).  If I had to make a small 
correction to your submission to get it to compile and link, or if I had to 
construct a Makefile for you (as one was required), then you lost a mark for each 
instance.

You may see, download, and run a (cleaned up version of) the marking script here:

  http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/project/markme.sh

(careful to preserve tabs in the file when you download it).

If your project could be compiled and tested, it was executed against each of 20 
tests. Each test was performed in a fresh directory, with a single Bakefile created 
just for that test. Your project received either 2,1, or 0 marks for each test, 
depending on whether it produced/printed the expected result/answer, appeared to do 
nothing, or whether it crashed.  All debug output produced by your project (which 
killed the opportunity for much automated marking) was ignored.

If your submission received 0/40 for compiling (0/4) and testing (0/36), then it is 
genuinely because your submission produced so many compilation errors that it looks 
like it has never been compiled, and I couldn't understand your logic and correct 
the errors, in a reasonable time, to successfully compile it to undertake some 
testing.  But I honestly don't think that is my role when marking, and certainly not
for a 2nd year unit.  If you believe you've been harshly done by in receiving 0/40
for this 2nd part, please contact me with your reasoning, else your mark will stand.

There are a number of submissions that have compiled and can successfully run the 
first test or two, but then fail most subsequent tests in almost the same way each 
time - a segmentation violation or an abort trap (usually from accessing an invalid 
pointer), or with a malloc/realloc/free error.  I have resolved about 20 of these 
cases already - to enable them to run and pass more tests - but for others it's 
difficult to award them any marks for testing. After exam marking is finished, I'll 
have another look at some (of the challenging) ones.  If, since submission, you've 
discovered a short/simple fix to your project, please let me know.

If your mark is listed as NOT SUBMITTED it's because none of the submissions 
included your student number (or a number close to it). If you submitted a project 
individually, then you may have submitted it to the wrong place (another unit?).  If 
you worked with someone else then it's most likely they forgot to include your 
details on the submission.  In either case, let me know the story and it can be 
resolved.

If your mark is listed as WITHHELD then, I'm afraid, I've referred you (and likely 
your project partner) to the Faculty's Academic Conduct Advisor for submitting work 
too similar to that of another submission, or in cases where I've been able to 
identify contract cheating.  The Faculty Office will be in contact with you shortly, 
if they haven't done so already.  Please do not contact me about your case, as I 
must remain independent of the decision process.

---
If you believe that there's been an error in your project marking, please run your
submitted project against the provided marking script, and we can resolve any issues
(preferably via email, not through the help forum).

But *before* you email to report a concern about your mark, please run your
submitted code against the provided script (above) and view its output.
Instructions appear at the top of the script.


Good luck,

Yes, of course you can question your mark.
Have you run your submitted project against the marking script to see which tests you 
believe are not what you expected?

And, you'll have to give up on your anonymity, and I don't wish to conduct it through 
the forum.

But I won't have any free time until 4pm Wednesday (and maybe not then), as there's
still exams to mark.

Hi all,
As I am still quite new to the university, and quite dumbfounded by the outcome of 
this unit's assessments in relation to marks/averages, I was hoping someone could 
enlighten me with what happens now- scaling or what not?? 

 From what I known is that the average of a level 2 unit must lie in between 63-68? 

I would appreciate if someone could tell what would most likely happen in 
circumstances where the average of unit does not fall into this bracket? Thanks

Units are only scaled if they need to be (which makes sense).

For our Faculty, the required range for a Level-2 unit is 65.0%→70.0%
and, if results are outside of the range, they can either be moderated to sit exactly 
at the bottom or the top of the range (not changed to 'magically' sit somewhere in 
the middle), or an argument can be made as to why the marks are 'correct' and should 
not be moderated.

Hi Chris,

What materials would you recommend for students that thoroughly enjoyed this unit and 
did reasonably well but won't be doing any future CITS units??

There's so much online it's hard to tell what's any good. 

Personally I'd want to look towards "scientific computation" but I'm sure anything 
you recommend would be useful (if not for me then for plenty of other students).

Very close to finalised now:

Exam average - 31.7 / 60  (was 33.5 in 2017, 31.2 in 2016).

The exam was was completed 'as well' as in recent years, with 23 students receiving 50 
or higher, but with 112 students receiving less than 30. The 2 questions on operating 
systems 'theory' were generally handled better than the programming-focused questions. A 
surprising number of papers only attempted 5 questions of the 6, with one specific 
programming question being avoided by many.

Other than for any individual errors that may be identified, yes, the
marks for the unit are finalised  (they have to be finalised before
being released).

The unit average for all students, including those receiving zeros for
not submitting the project (37) or being absent from the final exam (26),
was 62.0%.

The average for all students meeting the Faculty's requirements
(described here:  http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/faculties/ems-students/exams/assessment )
was 65.9%,  which is with the required range for a Level-2 unit (65->70).

Of course, if you believe there's been a error in your result, there
are well advertised procedures to follow to have your result reviewed:

That's not quite true, but I can appreciate that the histogram gives that misleading 
view.

I've attached the distribution of overall marks.
You'll notice that there's a big 'bulge' of 21 students now sitting on exactly 50 and, 
clearly, that's the result of pushing a number of students to enable them to pass. 
You'll also find no marks on 59, 69, or 79, because students have been pushed to the 
next grade.

194 students passed, 114 failed of whom 79 sat but failed the final exam.
102 students passed, despite having failed the project; 34 students passed, despite 
having failed the exam; 19 failed both the project and the exam and still passed.

The overall distribution was not what I wanted, either at the beginning of semester, or 
now, but you cannot say that it's unfair (other than acknowledging that all approaches 
to scaling are unfair). Additive scale, where each mark is increased by the same amount, 
disproportionately rewards those with low marks; multiplicative scaling, where each mark 
is multiplied by the same amount, disproportionately rewards those with high marks; 
having to cap marks at 100 limits the scaling for those with high marks.

Whether you consider any adjustment to marks is fair probably depends on how it affects 
you. But, most importantly, no student's mark has gone down, no student has 'overtaken' 
another student that started with a higher mark, and any two students starting with the 
same mark finished with the same (increased) mark.

Of note, from next year no Faculties are permitted to apply any scaling; each marking 
rubric will provide the final marks for a project or exam, and the sum of those provides 
the final mark for the unit.  Everyone who currently believes scaling is an unfair 
system, will want to seriously think about their assessment from next year.

The project marks, by themselves, were not scaled but overall marks were adjusted, so 
the effective mark/contribution of your project (and test, and exam) have all increased.

Yes, you're welcome to look over your exam paper (though not to
take it away).  I "warn" you that exam papers have very little
written on them, in terms of feedback, as we have a very short time
to mark them all.  So I can imagine your paper, like all others,
will just have a few ticks, crosses, and marks on it to show that
it's all been read and the arithmetic checked.

I noticed that there was a gap in the overall marks graph. I thought this was odd so 
could someone please explain how that happens?

Yes, looks odd, and is misleading.

Hi Chris.

So just confirming, next year there will 
be no scaling? If the average is 40% 
overall then that will be locked in as it 
is?

Cheers

Pretty much, though there's (always) some exceptions.
In general, unit coordinators and even departments cannot scale a unit's marks, either because they 'feel' 
scaling is necessary, or to meet any Faculty-wide rules that have required all units' averages to fall 
within specific ranges.  So, from Jan 1st, our Faculty's current policy:

  http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/faculties/ems-students/exams/assessment

no longer applies. This is a campus-wide change and a good thing because, if you're currently taking units 
from different faculties, some of your units may be scaled and others not.

The new Assessment Policy is defined here:

  http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?method=document&id=up15/5

(the 'replacement' for scaling is in Section 9.2.3) and a summary of the changes is here:
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7N6N4ztBmd4


R.I.P. curiosity and initiative.
